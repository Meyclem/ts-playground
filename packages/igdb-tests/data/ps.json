The adventure itself is split in two parts, one being a simple tutorial while the second parts represents the game itself.","total_rating":59.4863800237743,"total_rating_count":6,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-smurfs--3"},{"id":65454,"collection":{"id":3979,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[59667,65450,65452,65454,65456],"name":"Twilight Syndrome","slug":"twilight-syndrome","updated_at":1507766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/twilight-syndrome","checksum":"7d4e106d-c60f-82b1-d5be-77d9b121534a"},"cover":{"id":46454,"game":65454,"height":607,"image_id":"cmkk2bkzju4d3h4hwwck","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cmkk2bkzju4d3h4hwwck.jpg","width":607,"checksum":"e439bb99-66ea-7556-b238-8aebd4a2a99c"},"first_release_date":837734400,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Twilight Syndrome Kyuumeihen","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":184924,"category":0,"created_at":1578787200,"date":837734400,"game":65454,"human":"Jul 19, 1996","m":7,"platform":7,"region":5,"updated_at":1578787200,"y":1996,"checksum":"183e8e2e-53f1-6e44-945c-9788fbef5573"}],"slug":"twilight-syndrome-kyuumeihen","summary":"Kyūmei-hen is a direct sequel to the first Twilight Syndrome game, continuing the spooky adventures of the three brave and reckless high-school girls: Yukari, Mika, and Chisato. The first mystery involves a girl named Sakura Himegami, who was killed in an accident many years ago; apparently, her ghost is still around somewhere. The trail leads to an abandoned path in the mountains; Mika decides to venture there, while the other two are going back to school at night, hoping to find more clues. \n \nThe gameplay is identical to that of the previous entry: the player navigates the digitized images of the girls over 2D backgrounds in a side-scrolling/third-person perspective manner, searching for clues, triggering scenes, and choosing responses and/or actions when prompted by the narrative. As in the first game, these choices may influence the course of the story, and lead to various endings of the chapters; reaching a \"bad\" ending prevents the player from continuing to the next chapter.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/twilight-syndrome-kyuumeihen"},{"id":43706,"collection":{"id":4637,"created_at":1512777600,"games":[20254,43399,43705,43706,43707,43763,45215,45216,45218],"name":"NFL GameDay","slug":"nfl-gameday","updated_at":1512777600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/nfl-gameday","checksum":"94b9073f-97db-5820-f601-413bb406b6ed"},"cover":{"id":51801,"game":43706,"height":314,"image_id":"sp8drii53rlxbfjuz7tl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sp8drii53rlxbfjuz7tl.jpg","width":250,"checksum":"439e5f1b-c6b7-1fd6-d92e-1482f255579c"},"first_release_date":1031961600,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"NFL GameDay 2003","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":89118,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1031961600,"game":43706,"human":"Sep 14, 2002","m":9,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":2002,"checksum":"fa951777-6431-8bce-c919-ba1237673366"}],"slug":"nfl-gameday-2003","summary":"The first game in 989 studios' PlayStation exclusive GameDay series to feature online play.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nfl-gameday-2003"},{"id":4697,"collection":{"id":709,"created_at":1391126400,"games":[4695,4696,4697,4698,5413,5414,5415,5416,5417,22240,135286],"name":"Twisted Metal","slug":"twisted-metal","updated_at":1391126400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/twisted-metal","checksum":"d955d78b-c446-5b75-0299-e9a0d8a3ba1b"},"cover":{"id":84608,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":4697,"height":800,"image_id":"co1ta8","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ta8.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"227342fb-b304-d0fa-5047-81af7f3fd456"},"first_release_date":909792000,"franchises":[{"id":361,"created_at":1392595200,"games":[4695,4696,4697,4698,5414,5415,5416,5417,22240,135286],"name":"Twisted Metal","slug":"twisted-metal","updated_at":1392595200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/twisted-metal","checksum":"1b8fde01-8495-d7bc-eda7-3d33b81f55ff"}],"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"},{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":11280,"company":{"id":241,"description":"989 Studios was a division of Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA) that developed games for the PlayStation consoles and Windows personal computers.

The game comes from the fabulous line of classically-styled Japanese shoot 'em ups, bursting at the seams with parallax scrolling, screen-filling bosses and other classic effects that you could count on from the games of this era. But the real beauty of GaiaSeed lies in its subtlety. The game has tight control, precise bullet collision, and a simple powerup system, while the haunting soundtrack stands out for its techno/ambiance mood, adding to the subliminal nature of the work. \n \nYou have a single ship choice and three difficulties. Gaming veterans will want to start on HARD, which differs only slightly if at all from NORMAL, and isn't particularly challenging anyway. You get two extra credits in NORMAL, for a total of 5, which is ample if you want to credit feed your way to the best ending. No one should touch EASY, since it limits you to reaching Stage 4. There are 7 stages with 3 possible endings, none of which are affected by credit usage. \n \nPower-ups consist of 2 main shots (RED and BLUE), 2 sub-weapons (YELLOW and GREEN), and an eIntense Shot' based on your main weapon which basically acts like a Power Bomb. Main weapons stack up to 3 times (RED: starts on 1 shot then 2, 3 and finally 4 shots), sub-weapons don't stack. Lose a ship and you lose your sub-weapon, while your main weapon goes down one level. \n \nBLUE is the Laser Shot, a straight line weapon with strong frontal attack which increases in thickness and power as you stack it. The laser's eintense shot' is a massive sausage of light cutting across the screen and wiping out all in its path. RED is Needle Shot. This is your typical V-shot weapon. Less powerful than BLUE, but when stacked 3 times has a wide ranging spread. The intense shot is a series of blue homing orbs target enemies and weak points on bosses, making this the best main weapon. GREEN is the Cipher Wave, the best sub-weapon since it fires four blobs which home in on enemies and can attack craft which are behind you, which is essential during boss fights. YELLOW is the Energy Blaster and acts like an additional V-shot weapon. Absolute rubbish. \n \nWith such a simple weapons set most players will opt for a RED and GREEN combo for the game's duration. Which isn't a criticism. Gaia Seed doesn't distract you with superfluity; it's functional, with a focus on dodging and shooting. What's especially cool, and sets it apart from other shmups, is that both your health bar and Intense Shot bar are continuously recharging. This effectively gives you infinitely spawning power bombs and infinite health - but it doesn't break the game's balancing. \n \nEnemies frequently use screen-filling beam-based draining weapons, forcing you to let off a volley of shots and then scramble out of the beam's attack before your life is fully drained. With bosses this creates some intense battles of endurance - especially if you're trying to beat them by letting the timer run down (those are some pretty intense 120 seconds). After escaping a draining blast you can lick your wounds at the screen's edge, healing while avoiding bullet patterns. The patterns are fairly busy but without ever reaching danmaku levels of weaving. A slight comparison could be made to Deep Blue on the PC Engine, which had a recharging health bar and encouraged enemy avoidance (as pointed out by Mag Weasel). \n \nA mention must go to Gaia Seed's timed bosses. Defeating them by letting the timer reach zero doesn't do much during the main game apart from giving you a sense of accomplishment, but if you want to see the best ending you'll let the two final Stage 7 bosses' live. \n \nVisually almost everything is sprite based, though it varies in terms of quality. The first stage contains hundreds of massive though pixelated objects moving around, while the second has some interesting Mode 7 styled screen rotation effects. Stage 3 contains some decent parallax scrolling, though not as good as in Thunder Force IV. Subsequent levels are reasonable but without flair. \n \nThe stand out element of Gaia Seed though has to be its soundtrack, which almost warrants download alone. It's extremely unconventional, being a blend of ambient music with chanting, classical music, hip-hop and thumping techno. Stage 2's track almost sounds as if it's been taken from Panzer Dragoon Saga. It's eclectic, strange, and very good. The sole composer was Xacs Ishikawa, also known as Naoto Ishikawa, a fairly obscure composer connected to works like Psyvariar and Touhou. Interestingly, he also collaborated with Harumi Shiina to remix Koji Endo's King's Field soundtrack, to create an album called Invitation to the Graveyard ~ King's Field I Arrange Collection.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gaia-seed-project-seed-trap"},{"id":20262,"collection":{"id":2246,"created_at":1468281600,"games":[20260,20261,20262,20263,20264,20265,20266,20267],"name":"NBA ShootOut","slug":"nba-shootout","updated_at":1468281600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/nba-shootout","checksum":"f30bcc71-596d-d832-cc8f-89454ebf6c7b"},"cover":{"id":51023,"game":20262,"height":638,"image_id":"bp3cqo61o8jagd8w7bly","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bp3cqo61o8jagd8w7bly.jpg","width":539,"checksum":"ae6c65d0-0d2b-030a-cec5-11a28d11d8f1"},"first_release_date":892252800,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"NBA ShootOut 98","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":88217,"category":0,"created_at":1498780800,"date":892252800,"game":20262,"human":"Apr 11, 1998","m":4,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1498780800,"y":1998,"checksum":"a13df2d3-cf7b-7dfd-195a-a9faa8b6f84e"}],"slug":"nba-shootout-98","summary":"NBA ShootOut 98 is the 1998 entry into the popular ShootOut series based on the NBA..","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nba-shootout-98"},{"id":43932,"collection":{"id":1550,"created_at":1438732800,"games":[10624,10658,10663,11557,11558,11559,19998,43932,69229],"name":"All-Star Baseball","slug":"all-star-baseball","updated_at":1438732800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/all-star-baseball","checksum":"19f96cc8-6d88-9e5d-fa5b-f88c68d92165"},"cover":{"id":28402,"game":43932,"height":1405,"image_id":"oliuhvhbui1bpj6ljr1s","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oliuhvhbui1bpj6ljr1s.jpg","width":1395,"checksum":"cdfd2513-fc16-b13e-e471-4868d11f7950"},"first_release_date":870220800,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"All-Star 1997 Featuring Frank Thomas","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99250,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":870220800,"game":43932,"human":"Jul 30, 1997","m":7,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1997,"checksum":"4f9a3919-8cda-9791-f354-80213349fc9f"}],"slug":"all-star-1997-featuring-frank-thomas","summary":"All-Star Baseball 97 brings to the plate several features that build upon 1996's Frank Thomas \"Big Hurt\" Baseball.

The player controls the titular Bomberman in a wide area, full of destructible and non-destructible blocks. The blocks can be destroyed with bombs, and may contain a power up that increases Bomberman's walking speed, the size of Bomb explosions, the number of bombs able to be placed, or the ability to explode your bombs with the push of a button or to walk through walls or bombs. Some power ups are temporary, allowing Bomberman to be immune to bombs or monsters.\n\nThe point of each level is to destroy each monster, and then locate the door, which is located underneath a random block.\n\nAfter every few levels, the player can play a bonus level.

For a mysterious reason, Gizarov chooses only one small town, called Gotaal. Immediately after having the town in his possession, Gizarov presses the population with heavy taxes. Landius, the son of Gotaal's mayor, fails to convince Gizarov to stop raising the taxes, and as a result, he has no other choice but to support the people in rebellion... \n \nThe game returns to the traditional gameplay style of the first two Langrisser games. You create your character and choose his class by answering questions in the beginning of the game (similar to Ultima games). Before the battles, you should recruit mercenaries, buy weapons and items, etc. Once in battle mode, you command several units led by stronger generals. Each unit has its own \"judgment\" ability\"; units with high judgment ability will perform more moves during a turn. \n \nThe story of Langrisser V is closely connected to the one told in Langrisser IV - the two games form a kind of a sub-series within the Langrisser universe. \n \nThe game's plot revolves around Sigma, an artificial human created by the great warlock and scientist Gizarov. One say, Sigma is awakened from his sleep inside a storage crystal in one of Gizarov's labs by Lambda, a girl who was also created by the scientist. Apparently, a powerful lord named Rainforce has invaded Gizarov's laboratory with the intention of destroying it. Meanwhile, a powerful artificial human called Omega, another \"child\" of Gizarov, distracts Rainforce. The two heroes flee to Regenburg, a country under Gizarov's rule, only to find out that they will soon have to stop a greater evil endangering the world - a new leader of darkness, who is after the powerful evil sword Alhazard... \n \nLangrisser V features classical Langrisser-style gameplay: you prepare your units before a battle, buy items etc., and in battle control various types of army units (archers, pikemen, etc.), together with the generals. The \"Judgment System\" from the previous game is back: your units can perform several moves per turn depending on their \"judgment level\". Like in Langrisser III, there is an element of \"love simulation\" in the game - at certain points you'll have to choose between various answers that will determine the further development of your relationship with the female party members.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/langrisser-iv-and-v-final-edition"},{"id":92425,"cover":{"id":91973,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":92425,"height":512,"image_id":"co1yyt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1yyt.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"b43db980-8d56-e8c5-ba90-4f1e989ffb61"},"first_release_date":943488000,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":92904,"company":{"id":716,"description":"Founded as a subsidiary of the Japanese company Natsume Co., Ltd in 1988 to publish games in the United States. \nThe companies separated in 1995 with Natsume inc becoming it's own business.

There are a total of ten planes to initially choose from (including WWII style fighters and stunt planes), all differing in speed, acceleration and mobility. The types of aircraft include a Lightning, Mustang, Thunderbolt, Corsair, Zero Fighter, Sinden, Messerschmitt, Spitfire, Geebee, Pitts and two hidden planes. Once you select your plane, you'll be able to freely choose any of the four courses to race on: Canyon, Snow Land, South City or Mountain. Watch for arrows or listen to the announcer signaling when you need to turn, dive or climb as you make your way through the course. \n \nPlay involves racing against the computer for three laps while trying to cross the finish line first. Find yourself lagging behind? Pick up red balloons with an \"S\" inside them for extra speed! After winning, you can then race on another course, choose a different plane, or try your hand at a Time Attack mode. Besides the one-player game, you'll be able to race against a second player on a horizontally-split screen. While the courses are not entirely open, those still having difficulty can choose an option to turn on blue spheres. These spheres will form a line helping players navigate the winding courses. Bravo Air Race also includes two camera angles for either a behind-the-plane or inside-the-cockpit perspective.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bravo-air-race"},{"id":43717,"collection":{"id":3858,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[4385,23154,43715,43716,43717,68261,68262,68304],"name":"NCAA Final Four","slug":"ncaa-final-four","updated_at":1507766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/ncaa-final-four","checksum":"c2b4a606-3db1-dd7d-a9dc-3af851bd3bd5"},"cover":{"id":51320,"game":43717,"height":316,"image_id":"dubeenj7tnijgcelbxp8","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dubeenj7tnijgcelbxp8.jpg","width":357,"checksum":"736d77c4-6bbf-92db-0fe3-595a4f54bbe8"},"first_release_date":866505600,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"NCAA Basketball Final Four 97","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":89106,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":866505600,"game":43717,"human":"Jun 17, 1997","m":6,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":1997,"checksum":"5c1fa5e4-666e-5aac-07a5-bbf980d3afe4"}],"slug":"ncaa-basketball-final-four-97","summary":"Mindscape's 1997 installment in the NCAA basketball series, developed by High Voltage.

The ultimate mission: seek and destroy the secret Tan weapons factory and perhaps put an end to this struggle for once and for all. \n \nArmy Men: World War - Final Front is another chapter in the popular Army Men series from 3DO, and the sequel to Army Men: World War - Land Sea and Air.

Players will guide the soldier via a third-person, behind-the-back perspective, marching him boldly forward to take on the enemy onslaught. \n \nThe single-player game takes players through five different campaign, each set in a different global location and each with their own specific objectives. The soldier has a host of weapons to fight off the enemy soldiers and vehicles, armaments ranging from rifles and bazookas to flame throwers. He'll also be able to procure vehicles himself. Players will pilot tanks, jeeps, cargo trucks, motorcycles, and submarines in their quest to destroy the enemy supply and weapon lines. \n \nIn Multiplayer mode, two players are able to compete in head-to-head action or team up against the computer. Capture the Flag is included, is Grudge Match, which simply lets them blow each other up until only one is left standing.

However, the term OF-1 does appear in the NES version's instruction manual, as well as in the official artwork for the sequel, Image Fight II. The game appears to be set inside a holographic simulator, like the holodeck on Star Trek: The Next Generation. In the NES version of the game, the first 5 missions are called \"Combat Simulation Stages\" and the last 3 missions are called \"Real Combat Stages\". \n \nTwo separate titles on one very collectable compilation for the shooter fan. X Multiply is similar to Gradius with claustrophobic confines and organic add ons to the ship giving it floaty, stamen like guards. Image Fight is more a chunky R Type tribute with nice multi directional shots and an old school feel. The rarest of the Arcade Gears series.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/arcade-gears-image-fight-and-x-multiply"},{"id":43920,"first_release_date":953251200,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"name":"Kakuge Yarou: Fighting Game Creator","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99293,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":953251200,"game":43920,"human":"Mar 17, 2000","m":3,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":2000,"checksum":"20682e7f-fab0-c00c-bfd4-8f05834acf1f"}],"slug":"kakuge-yarou-fighting-game-creator","summary":"Full-scale construction tools with the ability to create 2D games action fighting game!

This new device was created by the \"Critical Path Corporation\", under the orders of their president, \"Manfred Brando\". The device has the ability to jam all Weapon Systems rendering them utterly useless. \n \nThe terrorist group that attacked the colonies is known as the \"Black Ravens\", led by their fearless leader \"Timoshie Daldahnton\"...Codenamed the \"All Kill Wizard\". Their goal is to rule the galaxy, and the only thing standing in their way is the combined might of the U.N Spacy forces. This new device could change that... \n \nAs Ace Pilot, \"Aegis Focker\", it is up to you and the VFX Raven's \"Alpha Squadron\", to defend the colonists from the terrorists and stop them from using the device to annihilate the U.N forces. You will get to pilot the most advanced Variable Fighters in the U.N arsenal, and fly into the face of danger with your wingmen right beside you. However, things are not as they seem...There is a traitor among the ranks, someone who sympathizes with the terrorists, and has a hidden agenda of their own...Who could it be?...Your mission controller?, your wingmen?, your captain?...maybe even your commander? \n \nThe only way to find out is to play through the entire game!, there are a few key events that will pop-up in the course of your missions, where your choice of action determines the path the story will take and the kind of ending you recieve. Can you save the colonists, stay loyal to your friends, defeat the terrorists and stop the SDF Macross all at once?...it all depends on the path you choose... \n \nYou can view Gallery 1 - Gallery of CG Images from The opening Cinema and a Gallery 2 -Unlocked after finishing the game once, More CG Images of the Valkyrie Fightersand a BGV - Background Video??...a demo video of two valkyries dog-fighting. Unlocked after finishing the game once, \n \nThere are three Variable Fighter Modes: \n1.) Fighter - Your standard Jet-Fighter configuration. Used primarily for Aerial combat. \n2.) Battroid Mech (Giant Robot) configuration. Used primarily for ground missions, or mech to mech combat in mid-air. This mode only allows ou to use your guns as a weapon. \n3.) Gerwalk - Ground Effective Reinforcement of Winged Armament with Locomotive Knee-joint. This mode is basically a hybrid of a jet-fighter and mech. It maintains the appearance of a jet, but the thrusters become the legs and are pointed downwards allowing mid-air hovering. Used for ground missions and low altitude fighting, where both missiles and guns are needed. \n \nThe game is split in 12 missions and was released only in Japan.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/macross-vf-x-2"},{"id":44779,"collection":{"id":4224,"created_at":1510531200,"games":[42710,43400,44779,58538,65981,65982,66588,66589,69325,75729,75730,75731,75732,114152],"name":"SD Gundam G Generation","slug":"sd-gundam-g-generation","updated_at":1510531200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/sd-gundam-g-generation","checksum":"6b44c69a-a14a-8018-6dc5-faf53a8cccad"},"cover":{"id":44457,"game":44779,"height":424,"image_id":"wlqpos3enhcne68sd75k","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wlqpos3enhcne68sd75k.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"77d23b6c-0d81-ae4c-f66f-49943c49dd2f"},"first_release_date":937094400,"franchises":[{"id":820,"created_at":1466726400,"games":[3964,3965,5012,5144,6977,6978,6982,7074,7376,7377,19858,20401,20492,21502,23434,28287,38321,38324,42567,42710,42717,43311,43392,43400,43461,43594,43678,44552,44779,45006,45007,45290,45859,47870,48423,49325,52001,58538,65387,65981,65982,66588,66589,66596,66600,66609,67126,68079,68126,68160,68285,69325,72752,72783,72879,75695,75696,75697,75698,75721,75722,75723,75724,75725,75726,75727,75728,75729,75730,75731,75732,79530,82116,86532,87796,112429,112431,114152,120305,128773,132794],"name":"Gundam","slug":"gundam","updated_at":1466726400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/gundam","checksum":"b59c7a4b-80c0-3c27-1e3a-3cd83d8816d5"}],"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":57879,"company":{"id":617,"description":"Bandai Co., Ltd.

The Rebels are beginning to turn the tides of the war to their advantage, and while the Imperium armies are by no means defeated, there is a great deal of hope in the Rebel camp. \n \nUnfortunately, the Imperium has introduced a new weapon of unspeakable power. When unleashed against a Rebel planet, the damage was absolute. This new \"planet-killing\" weapon will certainly mark the end of the Rebel forces if it continues to operate. \n \nUprising X, by The 3DO Company, is a blend of action and strategy for the PlayStation. Players take control of a tank-like vehicle known as \"The Wraith,\" which is the most powerful weapon available to the Rebel forces. The majority of the game is spent behind the controls of the Wraith, although some missions will require troop deployment and the construction of Rebel equipment. The game utilizes a first-person view from inside the Wraith or while building in Citadel mode.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/uprising-x"},{"id":20725,"cover":{"id":28392,"game":20725,"height":1415,"image_id":"iwfub8xd7nmiiijtoq3x","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iwfub8xd7nmiiijtoq3x.jpg","width":1399,"checksum":"28aa134b-21fc-d337-22dc-587d63b5dae5"},"first_release_date":823132800,"name":"Tempest X3: An Inter-Galactic Battle Zone","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99226,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":823132800,"game":20725,"human":"Feb 01, 1996","m":2,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1996,"checksum":"f7078f9a-b269-3679-c288-d6806a6f2228"}],"slug":"tempest-x3-an-inter-galactic-battle-zone","summary":"In Tempest X3 for the PlayStation, you control a claw that perches and crawls around the outer edge of a series of geometrically shaped, tube-like constructs, shooting down or out into the nebulous void of outer space.

It is a sequel to the original in terms of the story and takes place on the Woolies' home planet, Rayon. Bubsy 3D has 16 main levels and two boss levels and the main character's goal is to defeat the two queens of Rayon, Poly and Esther. The player can collect rockets, as well as atoms, in order to eventually escape from planet Rayon. The graphics are very simplistic, even for their time, with a dense fog that covers entire levels throughout the game. Bubsy actively speaks throughout the game based on various actions performed by the player. Planned releases for the Sega 32X and Sega Saturn were cancelled.\nBubsy 3D was panned by both critics due to its confusing control schemes and camera angles. It was featured on Seanbaby's EGM Crapstravaganza: The 20 Worst Games of All Time list as well as in eighth place on GameTrailers' 2006 Top 10 Best and Worst Games list, where it was described as \"a terrible, terrible clone\".","total_rating":33.6776320592845,"total_rating_count":11,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bubsy-3d"},{"id":64410,"collection":{"id":656,"created_at":1390348800,"games":[4014,4015,12703,37810,37923,38068,38343,38344,48771,49720,64408,64410,64414,64418,79234],"name":"Momotaro Dentetsu","slug":"momotaro-dentetsu","updated_at":1390348800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/momotaro-dentetsu","checksum":"8b7d3c49-9da3-27b6-29b3-bd07ce8e2ade"},"cover":{"id":45395,"game":64410,"height":648,"image_id":"ps4esxg4bkrtkfyqpwtm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ps4esxg4bkrtkfyqpwtm.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"86921098-2620-9d82-5896-f870ed345c40"},"first_release_date":1048723200,"genres":[{"id":26,"created_at":1301961600,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","slug":"quiz-trivia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/quiz-trivia","checksum":"256a99dd-dd06-bc0c-d53b-dc3098da4d49"}],"name":"Momotaro Dentetsu 7","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":122633,"category":0,"created_at":1508112000,"date":1048723200,"game":64410,"human":"Mar 27, 2003","m":3,"platform":7,"region":5,"updated_at":1508112000,"y":2003,"checksum":"cb58dc42-5ad8-1d1a-c169-84d2a7e81e65"}],"slug":"momotaro-dentetsu-7","summary":"Seventh MTDT game.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/momotaro-dentetsu-7"},{"id":41855,"collection":{"id":39,"created_at":1300320000,"games":[359,385,386,387,388,392,393,395,397,398,399,400,402,404,405,406,408,409,411,413,415,416,417,418,419,420,421,423,425,426,2406,5679,6902,7398,7399,7400,7413,8549,10319,11214,14144,16474,16587,17463,19080,19334,19455,19600,20597,20655,21628,21779,21880,21899,23265,26069,26625,26981,27410,28002,36998,37087,37193,37291,37563,38492,38493,41052,41831,41834,41835,41836,41837,41838,41839,41840,41842,41843,41845,41851,41852,41853,41854,41855,41856,55034,55035,55049,57862,60600,65986,66433,71219,75680,75681,76430,77234,80589,80877,90563,108156,119374,121688,121717,127876,127879,129890,131995],"name":"Final Fantasy","slug":"final-fantasy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/final-fantasy","checksum":"d120a5d1-da5c-99d7-80e0-4563606e0e12"},"cover":{"id":87598,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":41855,"height":452,"image_id":"co1vla","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1vla.jpg","width":339,"checksum":"ba5d8661-ba78-4ba7-af89-ff8db1c51375"},"first_release_date":921110400,"franchises":[{"id":4,"created_at":1301443200,"games":[359,384,385,386,387,388,389,391,392,393,394,395,396,397,398,399,400,401,402,403,405,406,407,408,409,410,411,412,413,414,415,416,417,418,419,420,421,423,425,426,427,428,2406,2407,2408,2449,7356,7398,7399,7400,7413,9585,10319,11169,11214,14144,14723,14729,16587,17463,18068,18069,18070,19080,19334,19455,19600,19865,20597,20655,21054,21628,21779,21880,21899,22894,22895,22896,22897,22899,22900,22901,22902,22903,22904,22905,22906,22907,22908,22909,23016,24010,24288,24400,26069,26625,26904,27410,28002,36831,36998,37087,37193,37291,38492,38493,41052,41830,41831,41834,41835,41836,41837,41838,41839,41840,41841,41842,41843,41845,41848,41851,41852,41853,41854,41855,41856,49559,51532,54550,55034,55035,55049,57793,69176,75680,75681,76160,76163,76430,77234,80877,81206,84174,90563,106819,108156,109276,109461,109465,112412,112885,113632,119374,121688,121717,125583,127876,127879,129157,131995],"name":"Final Fantasy","slug":"final-fantasy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/final-fantasy","checksum":"68dec670-d60a-4632-2f75-b05269a4907b"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":89076,"company":{"id":26,"description":"Square Enix develops, publishes, distributes and licenses Square Enix, Eidos and Taito branded entertainment content in Europe and other PAL territories as part of the Square Enix group of companies.

Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal were not represented in the game. In early 2000s versions, Michael Jordan is included as a member of the Washington Wizards. Earlier versions of the game made it extremely difficult for players to slam dunk, a problem that was rectified in later games.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nba-shootout-2003"},{"id":44861,"cover":{"id":56012,"game":44861,"height":693,"image_id":"tcy1m8ckugvg2ef0cflh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tcy1m8ckugvg2ef0cflh.jpg","width":697,"checksum":"63656e8f-ef66-4b2f-fd31-8b8bc41ce814"},"first_release_date":964828800,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"},{"id":7,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Music","slug":"music","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/music","checksum":"22d44a0d-89c7-580f-eef2-e06f178fdd47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":79626,"company":{"id":2539,"logo":{"id":1062,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":154,"image_id":"izgqcuifq7lqv9zypyvx","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/izgqcuifq7lqv9zypyvx.jpg","width":93,"checksum":"61cad602-d2b7-766f-6e71-f8590dc17773"},"name":"ASK","slug":"ask"}},{"id":79627,"company":{"id":1919,"logo":{"id":1293,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":309,"image_id":"ptwxczruwrhpet3kgump","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ptwxczruwrhpet3kgump.jpg","width":426,"checksum":"a4f4674f-046d-06e1-0388-fe0cf05fdf36"},"name":"Polygon Magic","slug":"polygon-magic"}}],"name":"Slap Happy Rhythm Busters","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99459,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":964828800,"game":44861,"human":"Jul 29, 2000","m":7,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":2000,"checksum":"18599730-d148-701c-6931-84bb7f48ad52"}],"screenshots":[{"id":112605,"game":44861,"height":700,"image_id":"mqms3byl7r73gcgocutk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mqms3byl7r73gcgocutk.jpg","width":1416,"checksum":"cb649916-bf37-d01a-f1d1-56dd2d8993e6"},{"id":307357,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":44861,"height":480,"image_id":"sc6l5p","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6l5p.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"9f290e74-434d-43a0-5588-37cf2c54a1fd"},{"id":307358,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":44861,"height":480,"image_id":"sc6l5q","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6l5q.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"872b6b93-d91e-7143-816a-0ba2a1662926"},{"id":307359,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":44861,"height":480,"image_id":"sc6l5r","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6l5r.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"f9a8df76-53dd-b104-0135-2f9473f4bdf7"}],"slug":"slap-happy-rhythm-busters","summary":"In this anything goes world, take to the beat of DJ Shinkawa's music to win the fight!

You take on the role of Dark Schneider, an evil wizard who parts on a quest to regain back his memory. The gameplay isn’t really deep, you just go from one boss to another. You have tons of magic moves to use in battle and you can even combine them to create devastating spells. One major disadvantage is that the game was only aimed at the readers of the manga, so if you haven’t read the manga, you won’t understand anything of the characters and the background story. \n \nBastard? Destructive God of Darkness is a manga by Kazushi Hagiwara. It first appeared in Weekly Shonen Jump, in 1988, and continues to be published irregularly today in Ultra Jump. Currently, it spans 25 volumes. \n \nIn Bastard?, the Kingdom of Meta-Rikana is attacked by four armies. This prompts Dark Schneider, a wizard, to awaken within the body of 14-year old Lucian Lenren. \n \nBastard?'s history is about sorcery, revenge, and other power struggles in a Dungeons & Dragons-like world. It is a dystopian world, where people need magic to survive against wild beasts, and evil monsters. There are endless rulers, each one with his own army of knights and mages, who fight for survival against those beasts and the armies of multiple evil sorcerers. \n \nIn the anime, the six episodes tell of the awakening of Dark Schneider (also called Darsh or Darshu by those who know him well) and his subsequent attempts to destroy his old allies (The Four Lords of Havoc) and take over the world, whilst winning over multiple love interests. Dark Schneider had been imprisoned fifteen years earlier, trapped inside the body of Yoko's friend Lucien following a failed attempt to take over the world. In the meantime, his four generals attempted to resurrect the god Anthrasax, who would bring about an apocalypse and create the Sorcerer's Kingdom from the ashes of the old world. \n \nThe story takes place in the future, a post-apocalyptic time following the release of Anthrasax at the height of Modern Civilization. Technology is gone and magic has asserted itself as a force in the world. Shortly after the fall of the modern world, demonic creatures began to appear en masse and forced humans to revert to a feudalistic, city-state based society. The episodes are rather disjointed, with scenes missing in between episodes making it hard to follow, but taken at face value it makes enough sense. \n \nManufacturer's description: \n \nHagiwara Hazime solstitial popular comic \"BASTARD!!\" based on an original story developed in RPG. And the battle system with a highly strategic position is reflected in the war situation and the compatibility of the character. Dark Schneider is working with the hero lost memory, to return to the real world back memories, let our adventure with friends. \n \nFeatures: \nFirst person perspective \n2D & 3D graphics \nCartoon graphics \nSCI-FI, Futuristic, Magic & Anime themes. \n \nBASIC CONTROLS: \nMove character / Move between actions - D-Pad \nSelect action - Circle Button \nRun - Square Button \nLook down / Cancel action - X Button \nLook up - Triangle Button \nSide step left - L1 Button \nSide step right - R1 Button \nSave menu - Select Button \nMenu - Start Button","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bastard-utsuro-naru-kamigami-no-utsuwa"},{"id":20797,"cover":{"id":22725,"game":20797,"height":586,"image_id":"l39ktm0y5kwvf4lajfc7","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/l39ktm0y5kwvf4lajfc7.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"29fc1729-2aa2-0d0d-ea40-171aaaf5b965"},"first_release_date":846633600,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"name":"Tokyo Highway Battle","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99366,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":846633600,"game":20797,"human":"Oct 30, 1996","m":10,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1996,"checksum":"4a718c0b-c720-107e-97d3-69ecfda06700"}],"slug":"tokyo-highway-battle","summary":"Players navigate through three Tokyo highway circuits driving one of 72 high-performance sports cars.

Now her daughter, Melody, has decided to go against her mother's wishes to search the ocean for the city of Atlantis. Children begin the adventure as Ariel, reliving the events of the first movie. Once they defeat Ursula, kids change over to Melody and start their search for Atlantis. Disney did an excellent job making the controls simple enough for even young children to use.

The main objective is to destroy or get rid of (by dropping) all the bubbles located within the stage. Once you do this, you'll graduate to the next level. \n \nWhile the premise may sound simple, the logic and execution is not. Using a \"bubble shooter\", you must aim and shoot your bubbles to the top of the screen so that you can bring three bubbles of the same color together. When you do this, the bubbles will pop. One way to earn points is to have the popping bubbles as well as the bubble that was shot fall off the screen (in multi-player, it puts these bubbles on your opponent's side). This also gives you a lot less bubbles to take care of. \n \nBubbles are constantly falling down. Popping them all in a short amount of time is necessary because the longer it takes you to pop them all, the faster they will drop. If you fail to clear out all the bubbles and they reach the bottom of the screen, the game is over. \n \nBust-A-Move '99 contains some new options never seen in the Bust-A-Move series. There are now special bubbles (star, metal and rainbow to name a few), obstructive bubbles and blocks and new backgrounds. You are also given the opportunity to create your very own stages with the create-a-level editor.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bust-a-move-99"},{"id":43805,"first_release_date":1051488000,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Football Madness","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":89008,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1051488000,"game":43805,"human":"Apr 28, 2003","m":4,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":2003,"checksum":"19252718-bd7f-d6a3-57da-d4bd97e72ddd"}],"screenshots":[{"id":108544,"game":43805,"height":720,"image_id":"rg5ggtdvhfq9s27efxai","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rg5ggtdvhfq9s27efxai.jpg","width":1253,"checksum":"62bf84ce-8bab-4269-e267-ab4c28d19f7f"}],"slug":"football-madness","summary":"Feel the passion and tension of the big match atmosphere.

It is the fourth game in the Puyo Puyo series and the last set during the Madou-era in the main series. \nContinuing the trend of naming the games after puns, the name comes from a pun on \"yon\", the Japanese word for the number 4, but this time this is the only reference to the pun. \n \nThe gameplay in is similar to that of Puyo Puyo 2, but adds super attacks. Clearing chains now builds up a \"charge meter\" which allows players to use them. The only other addition was a new game mode which could be played with a number of different field sizes, smaller or bigger than the standard 6x12, however, it removes several game modes that were present in Puyo Puyo Sun, i.e. the tournament, task and chain training modes. The art is also vastly different to the previous game in the series and, of course, the Fever series; this style was only otherwise used for Minna de Puyo Puyo. \n \nSTORY: \nSatan has released an odd demon called Pierott. Pierott invites Arle and Carbuncle over to the “Puyo Puyo Circus”. All seemed to be just fine, Arle and Carbuncle went into a tent to watch a magic show, but Satan had Carbuncle volunteer for a magic trick he was doing. A magic trick? Or a trap? He puts Carbuncle on the stand, and casts a spell, which makes Carbuncle, disappear! Arle wasn't worried, she didn't even know what was going on, but later on, she couldn't find Carbuncle anywhere! She then has to start battling monsters and oddball characters in a match of Puyo Puyo to try to reach Satan, and get Carbuncle back!","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/puyo-puyo-n-car-kun-to-issho"},{"id":12897,"collection":{"id":1704,"created_at":1442966400,"games":[12896,12897,15436,15437,15438],"name":"London Racer","slug":"london-racer","updated_at":1442966400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/london-racer","checksum":"c1bdadd5-0453-10b4-5e05-f115c8a73ab6"},"cover":{"id":13476,"game":12897,"height":664,"image_id":"eqttxetgs4rqszy1qyb1","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eqttxetgs4rqszy1qyb1.jpg","width":799,"checksum":"56e1cf8f-4532-f7a7-238b-57312b7f7185"},"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"name":"London Racer II","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":37202,"category":7,"created_at":1442966400,"game":12897,"human":"TBD","platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1442966400,"checksum":"90ef264b-7cfe-5594-49ed-b976f9a1ff40"}],"slug":"london-racer-ii","summary":"London Racer 2 for playstation 2","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/london-racer-ii"},{"id":61633,"cover":{"id":36940,"game":61633,"height":497,"image_id":"yptiulfwxfygpdzpy54n","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yptiulfwxfygpdzpy54n.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"cbd0a0db-2cb3-9528-8b75-8179299e5c74"},"first_release_date":786412800,"genres":[{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"}],"name":"Nekketsu Oyako","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":121818,"category":0,"created_at":1508025600,"date":786412800,"game":61633,"human":"Dec 03, 1994","m":12,"platform":7,"region":5,"updated_at":1508025600,"y":1994,"checksum":"be04bacf-0396-3280-e5e7-92902fb34fc1"}],"slug":"nekketsu-oyako","summary":"A 2D beat'em up developed by TechnoSoft for the PlayStation and Saturn.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nekketsu-oyako"},{"id":20261,"collection":{"id":2246,"created_at":1468281600,"games":[20260,20261,20262,20263,20264,20265,20266,20267],"name":"NBA ShootOut","slug":"nba-shootout","updated_at":1468281600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/nba-shootout","checksum":"f30bcc71-596d-d832-cc8f-89454ebf6c7b"},"cover":{"id":54040,"game":20261,"height":492,"image_id":"g5jrrtjc00bcs5w8zdts","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g5jrrtjc00bcs5w8zdts.jpg","width":515,"checksum":"a60e7bdd-affe-fa9b-47bd-18ba341863dd"},"first_release_date":861840000,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"NBA ShootOut '97","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99615,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":861840000,"game":20261,"human":"Apr 24, 1997","m":4,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1997,"checksum":"6e38d587-7749-9580-7df2-06e7524f70d0"}],"screenshots":[{"id":112618,"game":20261,"height":720,"image_id":"oazdlhl7jbkm3zvs6udo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oazdlhl7jbkm3zvs6udo.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"5de6f865-d87a-42be-8413-aec4ac95c622"}],"slug":"nba-shootout-97","summary":"Nothing can beat the intense competition of NBA basketball, and now you can experience that action on your PlayStation with NBA SHOOTOUT '97.

Collect fruits and special items as diamonds on your way to the top of the tree. \n \n- Yie Ar Kung-Fu II: \nThe Emperor Yie-Gah (1985): Sequel of the popular arcade game, Yie Ar Kung-Fu. It follows Oolong's quest to become a Kung-Fu master. This involves fighting with a wide range of opponents in a traditional one-on-one 2D environment.

Opponents are well equipped with unique weapons and attacks. \n \n- Knightmare (1986): \nThe game is about brave knight, who shoots with arrows all his enemies and at the end of level their bosses such like witches, etc. Shooting monsters, avoiding obstacles, passing the bridges and collecting upgrades for your weapon leads you to the glory. Digitized music and sound adds more to ordinary arcade gameplay. This game maybe also about two brave knights (you and your friend) who does the same for the victory on one screen. \n \n- Super Cobra (1983): \nSuper Cobra is a side scrolling shooter based on the arcade game. You're a chopper pilot on a surveillance mission in enemy territory; your goal is to make it through the various obstacle courses alive and score as many points as possible. Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate. \n \n- TwinBee (1986): \n(aka Stinger) Save Professor Cinnamon! When aliens from the planet Attackon kidnap the inventor during their invasion of Earth, two Twinbee Stinger jets (armed with boxing gloves) are unleashed to rescue Cinnamon before the aliens turn the Earth into a giant ball of cotton candy! In this vertical and horizontal scrolling shooter, blast away unusual creatures and even more bizarre bosses, while collecting power-ups and super weapons. By repeatedly shooting bells that come out of the clouds, these bells will change colors, each color giving a different ability. Getting shot down releases a ghost of Stinger, which can be recollected to gain the jet's powers back. In the two-player mode, Twinbee (cyan craft) and Winbee (red craft) have the same speed and they can join \"hand-to-hand\" and fire a super blast. Also in two player mode, if one craft is hit by the other from behind, it will fire four multi-directional shots. \n \n- Gradius 2 (1987): \nGradius 2 is a side scrolling shoot 'm up.

The story begins as Valaimian troops advance into Nightweld, a peace-loving kingdom. Lacking the military might to repel the invaders from multiple fronts, Fazz - a mercenary and the game's protagonist - is hired to defend the Tower of Wind. Needless to say, this is just the beginning of a dire and perilous journey for the unwitting Fazz. \n \nAs you and your party trek across the world map, you'll take part in various battles. Ready-for-Action Points (RAP) determine which, as well as the number of actions that can be performed by a particular character. The more actions performed (and thus, more RAPs expended) during a turn, the longer you'll have to wait for your next chance to act. When attacking, an interactive gauge appears that does damage based upon where the slider is stopped. Stopping it at the very end will result in greater damage dealt to the enemy. Wait too long however and the slider will return to the beginning.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hoshigami-ruining-blue-earth"},{"id":44927,"cover":{"id":47467,"game":44927,"height":597,"image_id":"swlwjmi3wwuejj6yc5cw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/swlwjmi3wwuejj6yc5cw.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"cac360bc-737d-f917-8dc7-4802fa7ca626"},"first_release_date":932601600,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Ultimate 8 Ball","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99354,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":932601600,"game":44927,"human":"Jul 22, 1999","m":7,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1999,"checksum":"8bfe95d6-7a0a-1cec-80b6-df44f6e85666"}],"slug":"ultimate-8-ball","summary":"Ultimate 8 Ball offers 14 types of pool games with the majority of them supporting multiple players.

Of course, you're not required to race every single time you play -- you can explore the tracks for said gates, finding shortcuts that will give you an advantage over the opposition. \n \nRadio-controlled vehicles are based on performance ratings including speed, acceleration, grip and weight. There are four cars to choose from at the start of the game; whereas Krush is average in all areas, the Flame Dragon has incredible handling and acceleration features.

Chicago Blackhawks announcer, Pat Foley, lends his voice talents to the game for in-game commentary.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nhl-open-ice-2-on-2-challenge"},{"id":63599,"collection":{"id":770,"created_at":1391904000,"games":[4240,5283,7484,17203,37767,57801,63591,63593,63595,63597,63598,63599,63600,77782,78744,80664,113105],"name":"Winning Post","slug":"winning-post","updated_at":1391904000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/winning-post","checksum":"eb4907ab-9232-7c22-818f-a3ac6426650e"},"cover":{"id":37305,"game":63599,"height":512,"image_id":"pczyx0uhqpfq2tmzx1oc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pczyx0uhqpfq2tmzx1oc.jpg","width":504,"checksum":"a494afe9-9a87-f470-a47b-fd11999be931"},"first_release_date":888451200,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"name":"Winning Post 3","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":122157,"category":0,"created_at":1508112000,"date":888451200,"game":63599,"human":"Feb 26, 1998","m":2,"platform":7,"region":5,"updated_at":1508112000,"y":1998,"checksum":"058c6cfa-3dbf-5350-7331-d0e2482e9ed0"}],"slug":"winning-post-3","summary":"Horse racing is back, this time with weird-ass cover art.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/winning-post-3"},{"id":22223,"collection":{"id":2675,"created_at":1493337600,"games":[22223],"name":"Jinx series","slug":"jinx-series","updated_at":1493337600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/jinx-series","checksum":"e5fdccd7-b08d-e270-4be0-c5995552c36c"},"cover":{"id":32317,"game":22223,"height":1490,"image_id":"v00gpagzkctxzpsevqto","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v00gpagzkctxzpsevqto.jpg","width":1458,"checksum":"86892d77-11ae-9045-df34-053926dc3807"},"first_release_date":1043971200,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"name":"Jinx","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99482,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":1046649600,"game":22223,"human":"Mar 03, 2003","m":3,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":2003,"checksum":"81786dd9-84e9-8cc1-797b-c8fb5f28ca52"},{"id":116073,"category":0,"created_at":1507075200,"date":1043971200,"game":22223,"human":"Jan 31, 2003","m":1,"platform":7,"region":1,"updated_at":1507161600,"y":2003,"checksum":"d816c7aa-4b08-edb2-0c1e-d360da323af1"}],"slug":"jinx","summary":"Jinx is a 3D platformer for the PlayStation in the vein of other 3D platformers like Spyro the Dragon.

As in the previous titles, the player controls a fairy named Scrubby, who acts through the cursor issuing orders to the Norns when used over interactive portions of the scenery. Like in other life simulation games with artificial intelligence, the creatures can't be commanded directly and must learn behavior patterns through repeated actions. The Norns can get sick or exhausted and eventually die, and one of the main tasks is to manage the colony to avoid their demise, ensuring that all its inhabitants are well-fed and healthy by eating fruits and consuming medicinal herbs. A series of meters at the bottom of the screen show the population status. \n \nThe game takes place in space, inside a giant station with a domed ceiling protecting a closed ecosystem. The main objective is to open all the rooms, by ordering a Norn to carry a key to unlock a door or passage. Deeper levels have aggressive enemies and poisonous plants that have to be avoided by the Norns. There are blue stars scattered throughout the scenery, and the creatures can be trained to fetch and store them inside a machine, generating a new key after twenty-five stars. Norns can breed and lay eggs, producing offspring that takes some minutes to reach maturity.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/creatures-raised-in-space"},{"id":57543,"cover":{"id":38472,"game":57543,"height":640,"image_id":"krktcjjkaoxqertnv2sd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/krktcjjkaoxqertnv2sd.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"e90ad211-f618-e488-db83-38b8bd372f31"},"first_release_date":850435200,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"name":"Road Rage","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":112248,"category":0,"created_at":1504656000,"date":850435200,"game":57543,"human":"Dec 13, 1996","m":12,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1504656000,"y":1996,"checksum":"52816824-ea14-1ea7-c95a-da853fc722f6"}],"slug":"road-rage--1","summary":"A futuristic racing game from Konami that takes place in Neo Kobe City, the setting for Snatcher.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/road-rage--1"},{"id":44746,"first_release_date":1072915200,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Qix Neo","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99582,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":1072915200,"game":44746,"human":"Jan 01, 2004","m":1,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":2004,"checksum":"8dda9d86-d7bd-b576-1206-f10b9a640410"}],"slug":"qix-neo","summary":"The arcade classic returns.

To do so, it killed the ship crew and outfitted them with implants to infiltrate the human race. Unlike in the film, the ship makes it to port and the cyborg monsters infest the \"Nakomi hotel\". A female police officer and specialist in criminology, Joan Averil, is sent in to investigate \"strange events\" along with her partner Sutter. They discover the monsters, and fight their way through, rescuing two civilians on the way. Yakuza criminals also appear as enemies on the way. As reports of strange activity on The Electra surfaces, they track the infestation down to the ship and board it. Joan reveals that her brother Thomas works on the ship, and hopes to find him. They do, but Sutter is killed. They eventually manage to blow up the ship and escape. The ending cinematic ominously zooms out to depict the infested space station.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/virus-it-is-aware"},{"id":63368,"cover":{"id":33639,"game":63368,"height":640,"image_id":"iuiq47fhtfvgyrr2aqgt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iuiq47fhtfvgyrr2aqgt.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"f9f6dcff-032b-2d61-6315-68f6ee676961"},"first_release_date":945302400,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"name":"Love & Destroy","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":117985,"category":0,"created_at":1507680000,"date":945302400,"game":63368,"human":"Dec 16, 1999","m":12,"platform":7,"region":5,"updated_at":1507766400,"y":1999,"checksum":"5d495a22-7a34-e7c1-95f1-f72ef8839913"}],"slug":"love-and-destroy","summary":"A sci-fi 3D shooter developed by Inti Creates for the PlayStation.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/love-and-destroy"},{"id":44731,"first_release_date":872985600,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Arc the Lad: Monster Game with Casino Game","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99614,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":872985600,"game":44731,"human":"Aug 31, 1997","m":8,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1997,"checksum":"62a30599-b084-c9da-f578-2984b855540f"}],"slug":"arc-the-lad-monster-game-with-casino-game","summary":"Arc the Lad: Monster Game with Casino Game is a spin-off from the Arc the Lad series and a bonus expansion to Arc the Lad II, as it uses the player's saves from the second game so the player can compete in the tournament with his monsters, visit shops, trade items etc. In addition there is a collection of casino mini-games that complete the package.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/arc-the-lad-monster-game-with-casino-game"},{"id":44834,"cover":{"id":28450,"game":44834,"height":1382,"image_id":"kotxszddbsrvlbqfacxt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kotxszddbsrvlbqfacxt.jpg","width":1389,"checksum":"2dcd1d14-65c8-9d73-0448-7f9df6418dae"},"first_release_date":1009497600,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Junior Sports Football","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99484,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":1009497600,"game":44834,"human":"Dec 28, 2001","m":12,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":2001,"checksum":"659b1941-8952-0273-8809-42dd70b179e5"}],"slug":"junior-sports-football","summary":"Junior Sports Football is a Sports game, published by Infogrames, which was released in Europe in 2001.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/junior-sports-football"},{"id":44880,"cover":{"id":50870,"game":44880,"height":512,"image_id":"dusfkejurceouuoesppg","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dusfkejurceouuoesppg.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"c6be8fd3-fb93-deb2-3acb-ef9a6ecc4228"},"first_release_date":939427200,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"name":"Ore no Ryouri","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99434,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":939427200,"game":44880,"human":"Oct 09, 1999","m":10,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1999,"checksum":"570177a1-bf1a-e54c-dfea-80f4362efdae"}],"slug":"ore-no-ryouri","summary":"Ore no Ryouri was developed by Agenda and released by Sony for the original PlayStation.

While the options are fantastic and the graphics are gorgeous, the playbook is a layperson's nightmare - and game control is extremely frustrating. College football fans just shouldn't have to come so close, yet still be so far.... \n \nFirst, the good news: GameBreaker will be a treat for college football fans, whose games usually play second-fiddle to the bigger, badder NFL slamfests. GameBreaker runs on the new, improved GameDay engine, and has the options and small touches to bring out the school spirit in anyone. Then there's all those teams, displayed in fantastic motion-captured graphics. And let's not forget the abundant animation capped off with excellent pep band music and an echoing announcer's voice. In short, this game is simply gorgeous. It's easily the best-looking college football game anywhere. \n \nWait, sit back down. \n \nGameBreaker is knocked out of the game thanks to its atrocious playbook interface. There's little doubt the designers meant well when they compiled the mother lode of all playbooks. But the options are so numerous (and so spread out) that it's far too difficult to find the right play for the right situation. Even the special teams section is hidden, meaning there's no choice but to cycle through the entire menu to find it. With seconds left and no time outs, the last thing anyone wants to do is peruse the playbook. Simple features could have made play selection so much easier: For example, on fourth down, the special teams box could (and should) have been front and center. And if that isn't enough.... \n \nGameBreaker's got a tough one-player game - one so hard that even an experienced thumb-back can end up losing to the worst teams on the easiest level. This fact is largely attributable to the computer's ability to instantly find the perfect play and perfectly execute it (complete with precisely-timed stiff-arms). This may present a great challenge for the experienced, but players new to console football won't enjoy it at all...and with four difficulty settings to choose from, this is inexcusable. \n \nThis all adds up to put college football fans in a tough spot: There're plenty of frills, but no gameplay. College football freaks will enjoy this game despite the tough interface and gameplay. But first-timers (and NFL mavens used to the easy handling of GameDay, Quarterback Club, and even Madden) won't like what they find. Simply put, this game's not ready for the big leagues. --Hugh Sterbakov \n--Copyright ©1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Before you or your computer opponent can make a basket, the ball must be charged. Each team's charger is located in their opponents end of the court. Be careful, though: If the ball is charged with your opponent's color and you make a basket, your opponent gets the points. The same rule applies for the opposing team. There are different zones on the court and depending on where a player is standing when he makes a shot, he will score one, two, or three points. \n \nThere are sixteen different teams to choose from, representing the countries of England, France, the United States, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Australia, and Russia. Each team has four players on the court at once. Most of the action consists of passing, shooting, and stealing the ball, punching and sliding into your opponents, and a whole lot of running.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/professional-underground-league-of-pain"},{"id":45318,"cover":{"id":49014,"game":45318,"height":500,"image_id":"y86t8p1zp1uqlzm5kuew","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y86t8p1zp1uqlzm5kuew.jpg","width":489,"checksum":"8de6c84c-7f1d-586d-7e46-08d647927d2c"},"first_release_date":946598400,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":69536,"company":{"id":234,"logo":{"id":327,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":163,"image_id":"vqrxjoybi074egda8uew","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vqrxjoybi074egda8uew.jpg","width":113,"checksum":"8d2f2df3-d141-52f1-ab5d-b8f5f60dda37"},"name":"Cryo Interactive","slug":"cryo-interactive"}},{"id":69537,"company":{"id":1789,"name":"Smart Dog","slug":"smart-dog"}}],"name":"360: Three Sixty","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":158133,"category":2,"created_at":1536364800,"date":946598400,"game":45318,"human":"1999","m":12,"platform":7,"region":1,"updated_at":1536451200,"y":1999,"checksum":"7dc95779-9d25-dc44-9a24-fc27ca43af30"}],"slug":"360-three-sixty","summary":"RACING and SHOOT-EM UP ACTION in a world submerged beneath oceans of water.

In a similar vein to Atari's 1983 Star Wars arcade game, the computer is actually flying the ship, and the players are simply gunners given plenty to shoot at. In addition to bringing home the coin-op's \"Project Dragoon\" scenario, another entire mission, \"The Rising Of Gourb,\" is also included. \n \nThis mission allows players to follow up their recent rescue of the Earth with a desperate mission to save another world from the alien menace. Galaxian3 has little or no connection to Namco's Galaxian coin-op classic, and the PlayStation edition is only available as a Japanese import, despite the fact that it did make it to some U.S. arcades. \n \nInspired by the \"walk-in\" theatrical-style arcade game, Galaxian3 is a blast-fest for up to four players. While the computer does the flying in this first-person shooter, the players are trigger-happy gunners with plenty of alien ships crowding the sky as targets. Everything, from stationary gun platforms on enormous alien command ships to agile fighters, is fair game. Occasionally reactors and other strategic targets must be hit, including one sequence that bears a bit of resemblance to a certain chase through a certain Death Star. \n \nThe complete arcade game is included, along with an original second \"mission\" involving an alien planet that must be saved.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/galaxian-3"},{"id":1597,"collection":{"id":323,"created_at":1350259200,"games":[1594,1597,1598,1599,1600,1601,1602,1604,7316,14363,20426,22061,43027,73022,77993,80163,101006],"name":"Gran Turismo","slug":"gran-turismo","updated_at":1350259200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/gran-turismo","checksum":"b20a59b9-9be6-b2fa-2e31-a7ba3ce3bf5c"},"cover":{"id":93687,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":1597,"height":1536,"image_id":"co20af","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co20af.jpg","width":1152,"checksum":"8ccd143c-8481-8c3a-1123-b353aff9603e"},"first_release_date":944870400,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":19837,"company":{"id":45,"logo":{"id":885,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":1024,"image_id":"djkfinra1pds0bnz83gt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/djkfinra1pds0bnz83gt.jpg","width":711,"checksum":"e3824481-0a57-aea1-a73b-f6eafe351b26"},"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.

There is a wide variety of offensive and defensive moves you can use to make things easier, including dives, spins, hurdles, jukes, and stiff arms on offense; and dives, jumps, forearm bashes, and swim moves on defense. Basically, if you've seen it done in the real NFL, then chances are you'll see it in NFL GAMEDAY. Things like long snap counts, men in motion, and defensive stunts can all be found in the game, giving you an NFL experience like no other.

Above ground, peace returned again. \n \nHalf a year passed, suddenly the Blocks began to overflow in three nations.One after another America, India and Egypt became flooded in blocks. \n \nSusumu Hori and his Rival Driller, Anna Hottenmeyer; urgently began to dig to the depths of the earth. Meanwhile, Susumu's father, Taizou Hori; Susumu'selder brother, Ataru Hori; Anna's Robot Assistant, Horinger Z and Susumu's roomate, Puchi, were all digging to the depths of the earth, aiming for the resolution of this disaster. \n \nWhat is the probable cause of this latest incident? \nAnd, among the 6 Drillers, who will be the one to resolve this disaster? \n \nOur hero can drill up, down, left and right. Drilling through single blocks would take forever, so it's fortunate that blocks of the same color form into groups that vanish when only one of the blocks is drilled. This allows for chain reactions, since vanishing blocks will often cause other blocks to fall and form new groups. Alas, these falling blocks are also deadly if they hit Mr. Driller. \n \nIf all Mr. Driller had to do was drill, life would be easy. But he also has to keep refilling his oxygen supply by collecting air capsules scattered throughout the blocks. The deeper he goes, the faster his air runs out. Hampering his progress even further are brown \"X-blocks\" that take five drill strikes to disappear and remove 20% of Mr. Driller's air when broken. \n \nThis game is a Japan-only port of the original Arcade game of the same name.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mr-driller-g"},{"id":57057,"collection":{"id":3086,"created_at":1507075200,"games":[38351,57057],"name":"Bounty Sword","slug":"bounty-sword","updated_at":1507075200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/bounty-sword","checksum":"f3f9e10c-c0e9-af5c-1e31-54896fcf88fc"},"cover":{"id":32349,"game":57057,"height":650,"image_id":"pzw12e1bqzq3in9qlymo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pzw12e1bqzq3in9qlymo.jpg","width":650,"checksum":"8713daaf-b909-1789-104b-e4df496e121a"},"first_release_date":901756800,"genres":[{"id":11,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","slug":"real-time-strategy-rts","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/real-time-strategy-rts","checksum":"aaa36cbc-2258-8653-a461-1358df8ce445"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Bounty Sword: Double Edge","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":116097,"category":0,"created_at":1507075200,"date":901756800,"game":57057,"human":"Jul 30, 1998","m":7,"platform":7,"region":5,"updated_at":1507075200,"y":1998,"checksum":"db00d913-0843-d14c-e6dd-88db6f2827e6"}],"slug":"bounty-sword-double-edge","summary":"A sequel to Bounty Sword, a real-time strategy game, where the player can choose between two different protagonists.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bounty-sword-double-edge"},{"id":8296,"collection":{"id":819,"created_at":1394928000,"games":[1373,1374,1375,4837,5586,5829,5830,7308,7866,8294,8295,8296,8297,8298,8299,8300,8301,8302,8303,8304,9272,10294,19405,101439,116667,125192],"name":"F1","slug":"f1","updated_at":1394928000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/f1","checksum":"fbfa8490-00ca-8183-0657-43e5fc93dc6a"},"cover":{"id":8764,"game":8296,"height":256,"image_id":"lpwjihy8w82pmu72zht8","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lpwjihy8w82pmu72zht8.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"204a8dda-1724-7888-40f7-e4169be72bda"},"first_release_date":909705600,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":20276,"company":{"id":662,"logo":{"id":2984,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":147,"image_id":"cl2aw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cl2aw.jpg","width":147,"checksum":"bb729cea-8a7e-20d2-29df-3b33c8c7fbb0"},"name":"Visual Science","slug":"visual-science"}},{"id":20277,"company":{"id":764,"logo":{"id":244,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":188,"image_id":"jzat4lzichs6b5oa1ptu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jzat4lzichs6b5oa1ptu.jpg","width":250,"checksum":"0075b068-3738-4f31-d257-8bc4a11b0aa0"},"name":"Psygnosis","slug":"psygnosis"}}],"name":"Formula 1 98","platforms":[7],"rating":71.39244373259059,"rating_count":4,"release_dates":[{"id":23917,"category":0,"created_at":1418256000,"date":909705600,"game":8296,"human":"Oct 30, 1998","m":10,"platform":7,"region":1,"updated_at":1418256000,"y":1998,"checksum":"37273aff-6ee0-d1d6-3fca-e1b9ae24745c"},{"id":23918,"category":0,"created_at":1418256000,"date":912384000,"game":8296,"human":"Nov 30, 1998","m":11,"platform":7,"region":2,"updated_at":1418256000,"y":1998,"checksum":"9882285a-c275-68fe-3b86-ea4e220b8796"}],"screenshots":[{"id":7752,"game":8296,"height":384,"image_id":"e787jjekp154gsiqnbop","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e787jjekp154gsiqnbop.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"d7724f59-bd9a-c38b-a4a1-85529657598c"},{"id":7753,"game":8296,"height":384,"image_id":"o4dvzd86ogzws5mfvsxf","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o4dvzd86ogzws5mfvsxf.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"44bc7785-b1c8-f1e1-348c-1cdfcf48f001"},{"id":7754,"game":8296,"height":384,"image_id":"j22gst3u9epwmxdbytam","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j22gst3u9epwmxdbytam.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"7c6daa9b-da8a-40f3-c138-dfb2f6d2f7b3"}],"slug":"formula-1-98","summary":"Psygnosis hits back with Formula 1 98 not only providing a new game engine and features but also developer Visual Science.

As such, it is recommended that players take full advantage of the armor.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bomberman-world"},{"id":43840,"cover":{"id":46605,"game":43840,"height":508,"image_id":"gxvl1ykfkczpniwj6qge","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gxvl1ykfkczpniwj6qge.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"4e9987b2-5251-1b88-32a1-f9bdd4d3110b"},"first_release_date":863913600,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"FEDA 2: White Surge the Platoon","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":89019,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":863913600,"game":43840,"human":"May 18, 1997","m":5,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":1997,"checksum":"41fe2e63-4021-c6c9-6c00-71aa15399566"}],"slug":"feda-2-white-surge-the-platoon","summary":"Feda 2: White Surge the Platoon is the sequel to the turn-based strategy game Feda: The Emblem of Justice.

Two players can compete against each other, assuming one has data saved on a PS memory card. Three complete Beyblades can be saved at any given time, with customization of names, gender, and parts (exchange or buy). Beyblades consist of five main parts and a launcher, including a bit chip, attack ring, weight disk, spin gear, and blade base, and players can carry up to nine spare parts for repair or customization. \n \nBattles require four points to win and features include special launches, shifting paths (based on the spinning top's parameters), special attacks, gimmicks (special powers inherent in some parts), and growth (to a maximum level of 19). Rewards are given for moving up levels, such as increases to endurance, mobility, attack power, and so forth.

Speed strips are scattered about the locales and will provide much-needed boosts when run over.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/running-wild"},{"id":45068,"cover":{"id":32921,"game":45068,"height":288,"image_id":"ew2iak1yglqxihad7raw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ew2iak1yglqxihad7raw.jpg","width":290,"checksum":"4a51c4f2-eefb-f21c-09ed-ab862bbe60d4"},"first_release_date":1040947200,"name":"The Land Before Time: Big Water Adventure","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99377,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":1040947200,"game":45068,"human":"Dec 27, 2002","m":12,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":2002,"checksum":"68aa90ad-e732-8bbf-3104-8e7a50e5a4c6"}],"slug":"the-land-before-time-big-water-adventure","summary":"Featuring characters from the animated film series, The Land Before Time: Big Water Adventure lets young players guide Littlefoot, Ducky, Cera, and Spike through 14 levels in four worlds: Mountain Pass, Great Landbreak, New Water, and Soggy Swamp.

In both games, you take control of a military general in ancient China, each with their own unique abilities and weapons. \n \nThe gameplay is simple: you destroy hoards of differently ranked enemies on an open battlefield. Your objective in most missions is to defeat one or more enemy generals. Each character you choose has a different storyline (this story mode is referred to as \"Musou Mode\"), with seven battles progressing the story along. Battles get harder as you move along in the story. There is also a free mode, which allows you to play any level that you have unlocked with any general that you have unlocked (you start the game with three generals from three different dynasties). \n \nThe difference between Xtreme Legends and the original Dynasty Warriors 3 is that in Xtreme Legends, the Musou Mode only features seven unaligned generals that you couldn't play as in the original. There are also challenge modes in Xtreme Legends not featured in the original. And there is a more advanced bodyguard system allowing you to name them, customize their advancement, and choose from more weapons you unlock as you play through the game.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dynasty-warriors-3-xtreme-legends"},{"id":43892,"cover":{"id":51610,"game":43892,"height":541,"image_id":"yuyol6nbfcrhlqpvdzie","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yuyol6nbfcrhlqpvdzie.jpg","width":550,"checksum":"af4888d9-fdec-91d9-d5d4-345d04088197"},"first_release_date":1050710400,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Big Strike Bowling","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99576,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":1050710400,"game":43892,"human":"Apr 19, 2003","m":4,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":2003,"checksum":"218c8dab-8d97-6ee1-a6d3-6a24e3e8d33c"}],"slug":"big-strike-bowling","summary":"Big Strike Bowling is a Sports game, developed by Coresoft and published by Gotham Games, which was released in 2003.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/big-strike-bowling"},{"id":44824,"collection":{"id":299,"created_at":1349568000,"games":[1413,1414,1415,1416,1417,43946,44824,45494,77987],"name":"Battle Arena Toshinden","slug":"battle-arena-toshinden","updated_at":1349568000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/battle-arena-toshinden","checksum":"5d2a10ef-4e9e-e041-ce83-7e47ae4c8508"},"cover":{"id":51907,"game":44824,"height":639,"image_id":"wwiwgv8ppusvgjmlnvg6","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wwiwgv8ppusvgjmlnvg6.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"194288f4-9210-ded6-e271-e772a0cae9e5"},"first_release_date":869356800,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"name":"Puzzle Arena Toshinden","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99536,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":869356800,"game":44824,"human":"Jul 20, 1997","m":7,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1997,"checksum":"ca6d0fc2-f797-1a07-fb21-df438b464e08"}],"slug":"puzzle-arena-toshinden","summary":"Puzzle Arena Toshinden takes the furious fighters right out of the ring and into the world of puzzle games!

Specific conventions used in American Pool include \"Texas Express Rules\" in 9-Ball games, the requirement to \"call your shot\" in 8-Ball, and the loser of banking in 14-1 Rack taking the break shot.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/american-pool"},{"id":63928,"collection":{"id":3697,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[63928,63929,78944],"name":"Startling Odyssey","slug":"startling-odyssey","updated_at":1507766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/startling-odyssey","checksum":"ea755b7e-6dbc-edfb-81a2-45351d44cf56"},"cover":{"id":37414,"game":63928,"height":512,"image_id":"u2ws1r1azqxthw1vwrfh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u2ws1r1azqxthw1vwrfh.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"61453bf2-428c-da56-4d16-efbfbd07f1b1"},"first_release_date":931996800,"involved_companies":[{"id":90165,"company":{"id":23369,"name":"RayForce Inc.","slug":"rayforce-inc"}},{"id":90166,"company":{"id":23369,"name":"RayForce Inc.","slug":"rayforce-inc"}}],"name":"Startling Odyssey 1: Blue Evolution","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":184753,"category":0,"created_at":1578700800,"date":931996800,"game":63928,"human":"Jul 15, 1999","m":7,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1578700800,"y":1999,"checksum":"9b1e8690-10b1-597a-d362-669199135e02"}],"slug":"startling-odyssey-1-blue-evolution","summary":"A PlayStation remake of the PC Engine-CD JRPG, Startling Odyssey.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/startling-odyssey-1-blue-evolution"},{"id":44934,"cover":{"id":56102,"game":44934,"height":630,"image_id":"ddggu0kj5ga2ujykvvcw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ddggu0kj5ga2ujykvvcw.jpg","width":542,"checksum":"3ee575ba-0ffd-703c-f3e7-9f8ee17912d1"},"first_release_date":1019779200,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"name":"Hooters Road Trip","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99339,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":1019779200,"game":44934,"human":"Apr 26, 2002","m":4,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":2002,"checksum":"067fd8e2-d44c-ec8f-fabe-2a2d5e5b4d5a"}],"slug":"hooters-road-trip","summary":"Fast cars, an open highway, and young women - Hooters Road Trip calls out to its target audience by its title alone.

Most notably, it gives the player the ability to shape the game's world of Fa'Diel according to his or her desires, a system which was incorporated through the use of \"artifacts,\" which are gained as the player progresses through the game. The player uses the artifacts to create different towns, dungeons, etc., called \"Lands\", to venture to and explore. This creates a non-linear gameplay, since the game is driven by a series of what would be considered side-quests in other games. Legend of Mana features three different plots which can occur simultaneously, and which do not necessarily need to be completed for the player to finish the game.\n\nLegend of Mana was a financial success in Japan. While the game garnered considerable praise for its graphics and presentation, many critics and fans were turned off by the game's lack of a main storyline.","total_rating":76.084190905712,"total_rating_count":18,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/legend-of-mana"},{"id":129857,"collection":{"id":998,"created_at":1403395200,"games":[129857],"name":"King's Field series","slug":"king-s-field-series","updated_at":1403395200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/king-s-field-series","checksum":"95be2144-9ad9-9815-e38d-630bc758b82c"},"cover":{"id":91971,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":129857,"height":800,"image_id":"co1yyr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1yyr.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"fa944819-39a3-e271-6ee7-e638869d7a1f"},"first_release_date":840672000,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":92903,"company":{"id":1012,"logo":{"id":1136,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":155,"image_id":"irwmnrvf0hny5wr0ap0d","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/irwmnrvf0hny5wr0ap0d.jpg","width":1772,"checksum":"c43bf16d-3e14-8893-487a-3864eaa94555"},"name":"FromSoftware","slug":"fromsoftware"}}],"name":"King's Field: Pilot Style","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":188705,"category":0,"created_at":1581465600,"date":840672000,"game":129857,"human":"Aug 22, 1996","m":8,"platform":7,"region":5,"updated_at":1581465600,"y":1996,"checksum":"290186e6-b13b-968b-328d-136f48e25d45"}],"slug":"kings-field-pilot-style","summary":"The three King's Field PS1 games form a trilogy relating the saga of a mythical country named Verdite.

Other features include two difficulty settings, easy and expert (which factors damage and wind into the challenge), three camera angles, and a free flight mode using maps unlocked in successful missions.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rescue-copter"},{"id":22826,"cover":{"id":28324,"game":22826,"height":1010,"image_id":"eg8hotplsb7ew1pownm2","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eg8hotplsb7ew1pownm2.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"eb8f2d7c-b3f4-9997-58bb-756f8c9978fe"},"first_release_date":922579200,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Big Air","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99072,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":922579200,"game":22826,"human":"Mar 28, 1999","m":3,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1999,"checksum":"007b8203-283e-e128-b124-5080d378301e"}],"slug":"big-air","summary":"Includes several snowboarding events - standard slalom-style, half pipes, races, and more.

Humans have terraformed and colonized most habitable places in our solar system, but the Galaga have only one thing in mind: destruction. The Galaga are mutated nanites that were inadvertently created during the terraforming process. They are deadly, autonomous and great in number, and you must blast them into oblivion. In addition to shooting Galaga, you must perform various mission objectives, such as collecting life pods and activating water turbines. \n \nLike in the original game, you begin this enhanced version of Galaga controlling a ship that moves horizontally along the bottom of the playfield and fires upward at wave after wave of diving, swirling aliens that eventually fly into formation. However, unlike the original, this game, depending on what mission you are playing, features a number of other viewpoints, including over the shoulder, top down and side on. You can fire just two shots at a time, but you can gain the ability to have three shots onscreen at once. \n \nAlso like the original game, GALAGA -- Destination: Earth features challenge waves in which you blast streams of enemies for points while not having to worry about your own safety. And, of course, you can let a Galaga capture your ship, then shoot your ship's captor, letting the captured ship fall to you, enabling you to double your firepower. Similar to Gaplus, the sequel to classic Galaga, this game also lets you collect beam power-ups that enable you to capture enemies, place them by your side and use their weapons.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/galaga-destination-earth"},{"id":3312,"collection":{"id":1312,"created_at":1429142400,"games":[3307,3308,3310,3311,3312,3313,3314,3316,3317,3318,10389,17450,19401,19402,19403,23781,25143,45164,45165,45166,45167,45168,45171,45173,45174,45176,57592,59942,65916,71080,71927,72386,73016,78256,78527,79607,117136],"name":"Barbie","slug":"barbie","updated_at":1429142400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/barbie","checksum":"a8d2a320-47f1-c96a-d056-c4e8301b5a6f"},"cover":{"id":100412,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":3312,"height":800,"image_id":"co25h8","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co25h8.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"9ee2c795-f800-c7e3-485a-155eaf8aeba7"},"first_release_date":915148800,"franchises":[{"id":150,"created_at":1388534400,"games":[3307,3308,3309,3310,3311,3312,3313,3314,3315,3316,3317,3318,16671,23781,72386,117136],"name":"Barbie","slug":"barbie","updated_at":1388534400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/barbie","checksum":"c37b28f1-0614-028f-691c-bd9948e9af9d"}],"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":8661,"company":{"id":1734,"name":"Barbie Software for Girls","slug":"barbie-software-for-girls"}},{"id":8662,"company":{"id":1735,"name":"Runecraft","slug":"runecraft"}}],"name":"Barbie: Race & Ride","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":7570,"category":1,"created_at":1388534400,"date":915148800,"game":3312,"human":"Jan 1999","m":1,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1388534400,"y":1999,"checksum":"e42ac270-a34d-5edb-1b35-00dc603e88dc"}],"slug":"barbie-race-ride","summary":"Barbie makes her first appearance on the PlayStation with BARBIE RACE AND RIDE.

Included are Asteroids and Asteroids Deluxe, Battlezone, Black Widow, Centipede, Gravitar, Missile Command, Pong, Space Duel, Super Breakout, Tempest and Warlords. The bundle also includes a souvenir sticker, a video interview with Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, press releases from the original games and images of game memorabilia. Atari Anniversary Edition Redux is mouse and analog control compatible and is multi-tap adaptable for up to four players. \n \nIn addition to the pure emulation modes, there is an option to display the cabinet art surrounding the display of each game, intended to give the player a sense of actually playing a stand-up machine. \n \nEach game also has a toggle for an \"enhanced\" graphical mode, which varies from game to game. For instance, \"enhanced\" asteroids merely has a static backdrop, whereas \"enhanced\" warlords is a complete graphical overhaul with new colors. It should be noted that the \"enhanced\" version of Tempest is none other than Tempest Tubes, a modification for Tempest made in 1982 by Duncan Brown.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/atari-anniversary-edition-redux"},{"id":4107,"cover":{"id":4423,"game":4107,"height":792,"image_id":"rci8brjs4j4aofdenpnr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rci8brjs4j4aofdenpnr.jpg","width":947,"checksum":"1950b21a-ca6f-d850-2412-a250504005fc"},"first_release_date":884217600,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":10649,"company":{"id":287,"logo":{"id":447,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":249,"image_id":"qfyuxpskaackdzgnneal","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qfyuxpskaackdzgnneal.jpg","width":767,"checksum":"110da6d6-cd7d-3338-becb-404a5e482d27"},"name":"Acclaim Entertainment","slug":"acclaim-entertainment"}},{"id":10650,"company":{"id":388,"name":"JVC","slug":"jvc"}},{"id":51040,"company":{"id":1221,"logo":{"id":1566,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":400,"image_id":"ydcv449hdbhjfwpspyy0","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ydcv449hdbhjfwpspyy0.jpg","width":400,"checksum":"b0ad2231-f84d-2dd3-d70c-b38007641afe"},"name":"Artdink","slug":"artdink"}},{"id":51041,"company":{"id":1221,"logo":{"id":1566,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":400,"image_id":"ydcv449hdbhjfwpspyy0","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ydcv449hdbhjfwpspyy0.jpg","width":400,"checksum":"b0ad2231-f84d-2dd3-d70c-b38007641afe"},"name":"Artdink","slug":"artdink"}}],"name":"No One Can Stop Mr. Domino!","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":108436,"category":0,"created_at":1501977600,"date":884217600,"game":4107,"human":"Jan 08, 1998","m":1,"platform":7,"region":5,"updated_at":1501977600,"y":1998,"checksum":"8448b0b7-05f0-7010-b5f6-b756d26ada5e"},{"id":108437,"category":2,"created_at":1501977600,"date":915062400,"game":4107,"human":"1998","m":12,"platform":7,"region":1,"updated_at":1501977600,"y":1998,"checksum":"544cc9e3-d415-3f1d-9ef1-9910a6102686"},{"id":108438,"category":0,"created_at":1501977600,"date":909792000,"game":4107,"human":"Oct 31, 1998","m":10,"platform":7,"region":2,"updated_at":1501977600,"y":1998,"checksum":"dfbb5ac2-26b3-b4ed-7464-6108a68f7a69"}],"screenshots":[{"id":78873,"game":4107,"height":240,"image_id":"huski3oqtnmludzotkv2","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/huski3oqtnmludzotkv2.jpg","width":319,"checksum":"fec7d0ef-9d93-20cb-9fa3-9622a7cdbaa1"},{"id":78874,"game":4107,"height":720,"image_id":"z7yqtk5hlidiipmthwha","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z7yqtk5hlidiipmthwha.jpg","width":960,"checksum":"05ad93e3-1176-e6cf-797d-639fc9e5dbb4"},{"id":78875,"game":4107,"height":720,"image_id":"hsutaxesyvkvwe5echuh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hsutaxesyvkvwe5echuh.jpg","width":960,"checksum":"28c746d5-b082-ced7-b66a-42e9aef93c5d"},{"id":78876,"game":4107,"height":480,"image_id":"sexxobkwfsly0hhdhqpz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sexxobkwfsly0hhdhqpz.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"f07bbac2-8ddf-205b-7c26-912a87175a2a"}],"slug":"no-one-can-stop-mr-domino","summary":"No One Can Stop Mr. Domino! is a puzzle video game developed by Artdink and released for the PlayStation console in 1998.

While reaching for his beloved donuts, he accidently spilled coffee on his work station at the MomSteel Steel Factory. Now the machinery has taken on a life of its own! Assume control of Charlie the Egg in your effort to find the reset switch located somewhere within the factory. The game consists of 43 pre-rendered levels and 12 boss characters, all of which are various forms of machinery, from Blast Furnace Bill to Rotato the Repair Robot. \n \nIn order to clear a level, Charlie must locate a certain number of time clocks and hit them with his wrench. To reach the clocks, he'll need to walk across narrow ledges, spinning gears, and past open flames. Besides using the wrench, Charlie can also jump, throw bolts and roll away. Items to look out for are paper airplanes (they'll give you information or clues), donuts to replenish any damage, coins to give you extra lives and fans to cool you down. After all, moving through a hot steel factory can be especially dangerous to an egg. The game automatically saves your progress to memory card, so keep moving and save that factory! \n \nThe most notable feature of the game is the number of impressive CG cinemas that play constantly throughout your adventure. If you fall off an edge, you'll see Charlie do a Humpty Dumpty impression, and if you make it to the next level by punching the last time clock, a transition scene will play.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/eggs-of-steel"},{"id":62146,"collection":{"id":4570,"created_at":1512777600,"games":[16967,48091,62146,80309,121167],"name":"Racer (Davilex)","slug":"racer-davilex","updated_at":1512777600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/racer-davilex","checksum":"13256040-42c2-be47-7594-8471190641d9"},"cover":{"id":54793,"game":62146,"height":500,"image_id":"oshwawlys61nppni559m","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oshwawlys61nppni559m.jpg","width":352,"checksum":"c01741be-a26d-9cb7-2abb-326fd6799bc9"},"first_release_date":1041292800,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"name":"USA Racer","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":191081,"category":2,"created_at":1584057600,"date":1041292800,"game":62146,"human":"2002","m":12,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1584144000,"y":2002,"checksum":"5fa3cc18-63cb-a3a9-6ed6-0a0eb1964bd4"}],"slug":"usa-racer","summary":"A street racing game featuring 11 tracks across the United States of America.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/usa-racer"},{"id":43809,"cover":{"id":43801,"game":43809,"height":443,"image_id":"juw5ieecwmfl3niexsyp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/juw5ieecwmfl3niexsyp.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"d5471850-4baa-afaf-0162-bde059b8b2ae"},"first_release_date":853113600,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"},{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"}],"name":"ZEIRAMZONE","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":89004,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":853113600,"game":43809,"human":"Jan 13, 1997","m":1,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":1997,"checksum":"674e0444-094e-975b-1442-d8e6c9e4dec5"}],"slug":"zeiramzone","summary":"Horizontal scrolling action based on the popular \"Zeiram\" special effects movie directed by Keita Amemiya.

Granted you can always breed more, but it can certainly set you back if your creature hatches at level five, but you lost a level twelve.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/monsterseed"},{"id":44839,"collection":{"id":2986,"created_at":1506556800,"games":[360,2361,2473,2926,3006,3166,3613,3782,3883,3884,3885,3886,3887,4066,4234,4406,4666,4806,5218,5254,5261,6200,6434,6589,6756,8067,8127,8130,8144,8149,8150,8151,8152,8163,8446,8447,8452,9056,10610,10662,10791,12052,12122,12826,12910,13379,17172,17753,17765,17829,18102,18142,19004,19212,19218,19761,19900,20390,20542,20627,21086,22325,22468,23586,24979,25911,27791,30977,36227,36312,40638,40695,43375,43499,43724,43737,43895,44013,44025,44839,44877,45043,45228,45564,45575,46210,46233,46431,46434,46446,46673,47392,47728,47753,47789,47790,47859,47868,48992,49153,49186,49190,49202,49275,49278,49282,49304,49339,49376,49404,49405,49406,49407,49409,49410,49478,49494,49841,49919,49942,50008,50016,50307,50372,50426,50478,51281,51370,53943,56042,57214,57622,57919,57920,57923,58005,58639,58644,58849,59938,59939,60193,60243,60832,61672,61680,61822,61960,62187,62415,63051,63272,63748,64080,65125,65155,65583,66737,67757,68735,68939,69051,69056,69231,69885,70222,70247,70250,70964,71089,71876,71987,72123,72135,72885,73439,73453,73552,73651,76602,77330,78004,78216,78286,78481,78482,78484,78590,78697,78718,79059,79552,79786,79840,79914,79954,80295,80666,81487,83509,83783,85089,85959,86045,89817,91476,97983,98009,98240,98278,98569,108251,109480,111548,113889,120809,122082,122508,122534,123397,123599,124644,127641,132153],"name":"Disney","slug":"disney","updated_at":1506556800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/disney","checksum":"df672d2f-6926-5223-d03e-11a37c1290e1"},"cover":{"id":82869,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":44839,"height":637,"image_id":"co1rxx","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1rxx.jpg","width":478,"checksum":"e150cf7d-03f5-5b3b-85e2-92883dcf1c5a"},"first_release_date":916790400,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":79357,"company":{"id":95,"description":"The Disney Games & Interactive Experiences business is comprised of internally developed, licensed and co-developed mobile products, as well as licensed console video games. \n \nThese leading, world-class experiences draw upon the most beloved stories and characters from Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars to create high-quality interactive game experiences, across mobile and console platforms, for fans of all ages.","logo":{"id":1384,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":220,"image_id":"wijwce4vydwaxtrxncqn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wijwce4vydwaxtrxncqn.jpg","width":220,"checksum":"3f6aeb7c-b02e-4d32-2eab-dc3481d78b96"},"name":"Disney Interactive","slug":"disney-interactive"}}],"name":"Disney's Story Studio: Mulan","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99480,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":916790400,"game":44839,"human":"Jan 20, 1999","m":1,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1999,"checksum":"b02cd168-c68d-1c94-604b-5da602541d11"}],"screenshots":[{"id":306951,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":44839,"height":256,"image_id":"sc6kuf","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6kuf.jpg","width":353,"checksum":"7dd037ab-be22-da74-ca5f-5c91235bccaa"},{"id":306952,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":44839,"height":258,"image_id":"sc6kug","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6kug.jpg","width":354,"checksum":"344163e8-b48a-de17-fac9-d705375fea3e"},{"id":306953,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":44839,"height":256,"image_id":"sc6kuh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6kuh.jpg","width":352,"checksum":"fe7f41dd-ded0-257e-de80-a561ba5af1a0"}],"slug":"disneys-story-studio-mulan","summary":"Mushu is given the task to deliver the magical scrolls which contain the legend of Mulan to the emperor of ancient China.

But this time the game wasn't released outside Japan, there were originally plans for a PAL release but for some reason it never happened. \n \nEven though Blaze & Blade Busters uses the same engine as Eternal Quest it has some huge differences: \n \n- For example, there are some very interesting features on the start menu alone. You can do things that you cannot on Eternal Quest, such as renaming the items in your inventory to whatever you want and even battling friends in a duel. \n \n- Character creation is also interesting. When you have assigned your attribute points it adds them up and assigns you level based on how many points you have. So, you may start off at around level 50. The game will not only give you level 50 stats but it will also give you up to level 3 spells if you have chosen a sorcerer/priest/fairy, etc. \n \n- The game itself also plays very different. You begin at the Roadside Inn, but instead of walking around you have a menu on top of a loading screen that allows you to talk to different people, start a level, etc. \n \n- Another great feature is that you can buy items from the Expert for Gel. This gives a bit more of an incentive to collect money (the only reason for Gel in Eternal Quest was the auctions). \n \nThe gameplay is your typical action RPG style. The game is also multitap compatible allowing up to 4 players to group together. There is big element of puzzle solving like any other action RPG, there is also an Object utility mode which allows players to buy and sell items they have found on their journeys with each other. The game has 8 type of characters which can be chosen from, all of which can be male or female.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/blaze-and-blade-busters"},{"id":1417,"collection":{"id":299,"created_at":1349568000,"games":[1413,1414,1415,1416,1417,43946,44824,45494,77987],"name":"Battle Arena Toshinden","slug":"battle-arena-toshinden","updated_at":1349568000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/battle-arena-toshinden","checksum":"5d2a10ef-4e9e-e041-ce83-7e47ae4c8508"},"cover":{"id":1386,"game":1417,"height":300,"image_id":"i01xn7imd0uzox4trg0z","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i01xn7imd0uzox4trg0z.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"6432fc2b-fa66-cff7-d6a5-2d50ed30be2b"},"first_release_date":843696000,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":3087,"company":{"id":862,"description":"Tamsoft (株式会社タムソフト) is a Japanese video game developer.","logo":{"id":502,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":104,"image_id":"ofpfvfdewbjouexfbofa","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ofpfvfdewbjouexfbofa.jpg","width":329,"checksum":"f3762020-5152-7cbb-33e7-c6d976fa0d66"},"name":"Tamsoft","slug":"tamsoft"}},{"id":3088,"company":{"id":863,"name":"Takara","slug":"takara"}}],"name":"Battle Arena Nitoshinden","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":3579,"category":0,"created_at":1349827200,"date":843696000,"game":1417,"human":"Sep 26, 1996","m":9,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1349827200,"y":1996,"checksum":"5327580f-9d4e-090a-67a8-e187fad1b12a"}],"slug":"battle-arena-nitoshinden","summary":"Battle Arena Nitoshinden is a spin off from the Battle Arena Toshinden series that was only released in Japan.

Conceived by Bandai Digital Entertainment, Countdown Vampires is one of those clones -- you will maneuver 3D characters throughout 2D backgrounds in a series of fixed camera angles while fending off unspeakable horrors. \n \nAs a police officer, Keith J. Snyder has been assigned a security position at the grand opening of Desert Moon -- a hotel casino with a horror theme located in Casino City. While overseeing security and making sure VIPs aren't being hurt at the dance club, something goes horribly wrong. As a sudden fire causes sprinklers to go off, the water turns black and transforms the dancers into murderous vampire monsters. Assuming the role of the brave police detective, a civic servant and the last remaining human alive, Snyder must unravel the mysteries of the black water while defending himself against multiple monstrosities. \n \nArmed initially with a tranquilizer gun, a shock glove and an unlimited supply of vampire-destroying white water, Keith J. Snyder will find and utilize twelve weapons and items throughout the course of his adventure. Also located throughout the hotel casino are computer terminals, maps of the area and vending machines in which helpful items are sold; at computer terminals, he can access an e-mail program that furthers the storyline. \n \nIn Countdown Vampires, Snyder's physical health is represented by a color-based condition gauge found in the inventory screen; green indicates a healthy body, yellow represents wounded and red coloring is fatal as Snyder approaches death. You can heal the character using various health items found throughout the casino. In addition to looking out for your character's health, you will solve various puzzles and seek out specific keys and cards for locked doors.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/countdown-vampires"},{"id":20130,"collection":{"id":351,"created_at":1357084800,"games":[667,668,1872,11401,18982,20130,26620,65114,68718,70336],"name":"Descent","slug":"descent","updated_at":1357084800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/descent","checksum":"97b721d9-691d-9907-a37b-c18cd2268974"},"cover":{"id":52025,"game":20130,"height":511,"image_id":"fxglumrapfjmto23poxi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fxglumrapfjmto23poxi.jpg","width":540,"checksum":"9706ba08-2311-b8f8-5e4a-059b1d6ed1a0"},"first_release_date":864950400,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"name":"Descent Maximum","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99577,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":864950400,"game":20130,"human":"May 30, 1997","m":5,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1997,"checksum":"b9ae18cd-db50-e654-2299-477b14bd0e8b"}],"slug":"descent-maximum","summary":"THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE... \n...your last chance to experience the nauseating feeling of total rotation, speeding through the dark, twisting mines of Descent... your last chance to encounter the unique sensation on the system it was meant to be played on... your last chance to explore Descent worlds unavailable on any other system.

Baby Felix was a kids animated television cartoon that ran in 2000 and featured infant character versions of Joe Oriolo's Felix television cartoon from the fifties. School has ended and summer vacation for Felix and his friends is going to be fun as they will be playing tennis. Players can choose to play as either Baby Felix, Kitty, or Tattoo, plus four others can be unlocked by achieving set challenges in-game. \n \nIt is a standard tennis game with an angled view so that the opponent's court is smaller than the opposing player's and as the character approaches the net, the camera view slightly follows it. There is a training mode and a progressive Championship mode. On different court surfaces, the ball moves differently. There is a meter for the serve where hitting it at a different point will give it a spin. Two players can also go multiplayer head-to-head against each other.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/baby-felix-tennis"},{"id":65452,"collection":{"id":3979,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[59667,65450,65452,65454,65456],"name":"Twilight Syndrome","slug":"twilight-syndrome","updated_at":1507766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/twilight-syndrome","checksum":"7d4e106d-c60f-82b1-d5be-77d9b121534a"},"cover":{"id":46449,"game":65452,"height":443,"image_id":"aez63ftxmamhgkpkuvwf","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aez63ftxmamhgkpkuvwf.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"5fd24395-ab4a-0e97-4db9-e82dbd0fe098"},"first_release_date":825638400,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Twilight Syndrome Tansakuhen","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":184923,"category":0,"created_at":1578787200,"date":825638400,"game":65452,"human":"Mar 01, 1996","m":3,"platform":7,"region":5,"updated_at":1578787200,"y":1996,"checksum":"87f74247-1a97-0464-9cc5-cf49ab376c09"}],"slug":"twilight-syndrome-tansakuhen","summary":"Every high-school has its own dark secrets. Well, maybe not every; but in Japan, this seems to be a rather popular theme. Mysterious disappearances, ghostly photographs, untimely deaths, eerie sounds coming out of the music room - all these things attract the curiosity of three high-school girls: Yukari, Mika, and Chisato. At night, armed with nothing but a flashlight, the trio of heroines enters the dark school building, prepared to explore every corner, and investigate every urban legend they have heard of... \n \nTansaku-hen opens the Twilight Syndrome horror adventure series, defining its stylistic traits and gameplay. The game is divided into chapters, each dedicated to a particular \"ghostly\" story. Unlike most Japanese-style adventures, there is physical character navigation in the game; the player moves digitized images of the three girls on 2D backgrounds, in a manner somewhat similar to side-scrolling games - though many areas feature a third dimension, like in Western third-person perspective adventures. \n \nThe gameplay consists of two activities only: walking and occasionally choosing a dialogue option and/or action, as prompted by the game's narrative. There is no other kind of interaction, no inventory, and no combat. Different choices may lead to different endings; the next chapter can be accessed only if the player has not attained the \"bad\" ending. \n \nTwilight Syndrome: Tansaku-hen abandons the nearly omnipresent anime/manga graphical style of Japanese games in favor of digitized images and photos of real people.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/twilight-syndrome-tansakuhen"},{"id":19287,"collection":{"id":2135,"created_at":1460332800,"games":[18305,18718,19287,19288],"name":"Clock Tower","slug":"clock-tower","updated_at":1460332800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/clock-tower","checksum":"61f47bb3-ac0c-cdbb-cd30-2e4a0906812d"},"cover":{"id":98210,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":19287,"height":800,"image_id":"co23s2","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co23s2.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"8e16004c-2f93-0535-f4ea-d626b3f98790"},"first_release_date":850435200,"genres":[{"id":2,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Point-and-click","slug":"point-and-click","updated_at":1323302400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/point-and-click","checksum":"ef2ff68a-f7bd-d2d0-76cb-c830bd6e3191"},{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":35456,"company":{"id":1744,"name":"Human Entertainment","slug":"human-entertainment"}},{"id":35457,"company":{"id":1821,"name":"ASCII Entertainment","slug":"ascii-entertainment"}}],"name":"Clock Tower","platforms":[7],"rating":45.3084033391121,"rating_count":7,"release_dates":[{"id":50910,"category":0,"created_at":1463788800,"date":850435200,"game":19287,"human":"Dec 13, 1996","m":12,"platform":7,"region":5,"updated_at":1463875200,"y":1996,"checksum":"faffaa2b-d4c2-66bc-7dac-530b19108a91"},{"id":50911,"category":0,"created_at":1463788800,"date":875664000,"game":19287,"human":"Oct 01, 1997","m":10,"platform":7,"region":2,"updated_at":1463875200,"y":1997,"checksum":"9d86bad5-0c75-f3ef-c90c-6d1c33ed579f"},{"id":50912,"category":0,"created_at":1463788800,"date":886291200,"game":19287,"human":"Feb 01, 1998","m":2,"platform":7,"region":1,"updated_at":1463875200,"y":1998,"checksum":"4f47d0f6-62a8-7cb0-2c30-8ce4fc9c9853"}],"screenshots":[{"id":23895,"game":19287,"height":597,"image_id":"seyinajcqp7qkzcld5yw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/seyinajcqp7qkzcld5yw.jpg","width":1013,"checksum":"f70c06fd-4fa3-fee3-90cf-f0f7e78d1924"},{"id":23896,"game":19287,"height":360,"image_id":"ng6ejk23ie445vkdhva8","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ng6ejk23ie445vkdhva8.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"c31aa7b1-1127-36ee-c79e-2a997a4659b3"}],"slug":"clock-tower--1","summary":"Clock Tower, known as Clock Tower 2 in Japan, is a PlayStation point-and-click survival horror game and a sequel to Clock Tower: The First Fear. \nOne year after the events of Clock Tower: The First Fear, in late 1996, Jennifer Simpson has been adopted by Helen Maxwell, the assistant of a renowned psychiatrist, Samuel Barton, and is currently undergoing treatment at a university research building in Oslo, Norway, to help her cope with her traumatic experiences in the Clock Tower case and possibly shed some light on the mystery that was the Scissorman.","total_rating":45.3084033391121,"total_rating_count":7,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/clock-tower--1"},{"id":43784,"cover":{"id":25626,"game":43784,"height":1540,"image_id":"uky9bdeiyfhgojp9jyk2","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uky9bdeiyfhgojp9jyk2.jpg","width":1504,"checksum":"b21a1836-890f-ddf2-29a6-96da1a360da2"},"first_release_date":896918400,"name":"Crisis City","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":89062,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":899510400,"game":43784,"human":"Jul 04, 1998","m":7,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":1998,"checksum":"0b5b8764-37a8-a590-101e-e452e05aaacd"},{"id":116819,"category":0,"created_at":1507420800,"date":896918400,"game":43784,"human":"Jun 04, 1998","m":6,"platform":7,"region":5,"updated_at":1507507200,"y":1998,"checksum":"7b5097d2-643e-38f2-555d-ecc7e0cdced5"}],"slug":"crisis-city","summary":"Crisis City is an action game with 3 different game modes: \n \n- Time Attack allows you to choose any of the seven game characters and romp through a selection of levels at lightning pace.

Taking place in an enclosed arena two of the selectable fighters enter into a gun battl. Scattered around each arena are a number of obstacles that may be used for cover therefore speed of movement becomes a great leveler. \n \n- Story Mode: You are allowed 99 seconds to complete each of numerous screens where there are several enemies to eliminated before the exit is revealed. Any obstacles standing in your way may be slowly destroyed by constant firing of your gun or taking the quick fix which involves lobbing a few of your limited grenades.

An imaginary game world, created entirely by the pencil drawings of the \"God Hand\". The characters who inhabit this world were created by the God Hand in the same way... Yukiwo, Sasami, Pitanand Tsubohachi; the four members of the \"Heroes Team\", and Daddy; who commands the mysterious enemy character army. \n \nCalled the \"Heroes and Enemies\", they are all controlled by their master, and follow their predetermined (created?) fate. Today a battle to the end unfolds... \n \nGAMEPLAY: \nRakugaki Showtime you play as a rakugaki (scribble) character, who must fight against other rakugaki characters in a square 3D arena. The fights mainly consist of throwing items at the opposition. However, throwing is not as simple as \"pick up, aim & throw\". In Rakugaki Showtime different \"drives\" can be placed on the thrown items by holding different directions whilst throwing. Holding the direction towards the target will cause a \"Forward Drive Throw\", which is like a faster normal throw, albeit weaker. Holding the direction away from the target will cause you to do a \"Backward Drive Throw\", which will cause your character to throw the item slower and in an arc, but it will cause far more damage. \n \nBy performing a \"Counter\", you are able to block most items thrown at you. If your timing is off, the Item will just bounce off you and drop down. But if you \"Counter\" just before the item hits you, your character will perform a \"Donpisha Counter\" (Donpisha means to trigger immediately), which causes the item to be reflected back at the original thrower. \n \nOne of the more important items in the game is a Smiley Ball. Unlike all other items, Smiley Balls will not be destroyed after use. Instead, every impact will slowly make the Smiley Ball go from yellow to magenta, from happy to angry. After it gets very angry, a sound clip of \"halleluja\" will play and the Smiley will be engulfed in flashing white light... it has become a Super Smiley. When you pick up a Super Smiley, you will not throw it. Instead, your rakugaki will unleash their \"Super Smiley Attack\", which in most cases is devestating. Also, your fighter may be able to use different Super Smiley Attack's by applying different drives, these are called Forward Super Smileys and the Backward Drive Super Smileys. \n \nLike every other fighting game that has ever existed, you can execute Special Moves. These usually consist of very basic button commands involving the directional buttons and generally the Circle button. Some characters have a whole arsenal of Special Moves, others only have only a handful. \n \nAround the stages are \"Item Points\", these are where the God Hand will draw the Items to be used in battle. You can make your character move to these points quickly by performing a \"Homing Dash\". To do this, jump, hold the direction you want to go and then hit the jump button again. You will fly over to the point you indicated. As well as item points, you can use a \"Homing Dash\" to quickly fly over to Smiley Balls, this is EXTREMELY helpful. You are also able to \"Chain Homing Dashes\", to do this, just hold the jump button down after doing a Homing Dash, and tap the direction of another item point before you land. You can cancel Homing Dashes mid-flight by pressing the Circle Button. \n \nGAME MODES: \n- Normal Mode: In this mode, you battle enemies in set stages. The difficulty differs depending on your performance, where doing badly (i.e. losing two times in arow) nets you crappy characters (e.g. Zacko) whereas doing well rewards youwith really good characters. At first you will only be able to play as Yukiwo, Sasami, Pitan and Tsubohachi, but everytime you complete the game you will unlock another character. There are 12 stages you must battle through, ending with a final rumble against the God Hand. \n- Versus Mode: In versus mode, you can battle to other three players or computer rtvals. \n- Training Mode: Here you select a character to fight against a Zacko who has an absurd amount of life and hardly enough brain cells to fill a pore on the human face. This isgood to test out damage for the different moves of your character. The missions are as follows: 1) Use the Smiley Ball 2) Use Items 3) Test your skills. \n \nCHARACTERS: \n- Yukiwo: Yukiwo is the standard well-rounded protagonist. He has an above averageamount of health, at 3928 HP. His running speed is Fairly Fast, and his Homing Dash speed is pretty Average. \n- Sasami: Sasami is a very agile fighter.she's skilled in the Kung Fu Arts. Both her running and Homing Dash speeds are Fast, which will allow her to run rings against most of the opposition. She is fairly \"light-weight\" though, only having 2333 HP. She only has a couple of Special Moves, and they are all pretty weak. \n- Pitan: Pitan is a cute mischievous monk, who speaks in Kansai Ben.. He has 3001 HP, his running speed is Fast,and his Homing Dash speed is Fairly Fast. Apart from being speedy, Pitan's greatest advantage over the others are his highly useful Super Smiley Attacks. \n- Tsubohachi: Tsubohachi is Pitan's unruly drunk of a father. He is constantly referred to as \"OYAJI\", which is somewhat Japanese slang for \"My Old Man\", \"Geezer\", etc. Tsubohachi is one of the most enjoyable characters to play as. Whilst your controlling him, he won'tfollow your commands 100% correctly, which gives you the feeling of playing as a drunk. It's a brilliant touch to this character. Tsubohachi has a very decent amount of health, at 4802 HP, and his running and Homing Dash speed are both very random. Relying on whether your pushing against or with the way he's staggering.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rakugaki-showtime"},{"id":64407,"cover":{"id":37932,"game":64407,"height":471,"image_id":"z9nc0yrs6bphy89pdzit","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z9nc0yrs6bphy89pdzit.jpg","width":461,"checksum":"11dd03f1-1a6f-d84e-096b-79a81424c7eb"},"first_release_date":1000339200,"name":"Momotaro Matsuri: Ishikawa Rokuemon no Maki","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":118337,"category":0,"created_at":1507680000,"date":1000339200,"game":64407,"human":"Sep 13, 2001","m":9,"platform":7,"region":5,"updated_at":1507766400,"y":2001,"checksum":"07fb7471-bd8a-868b-7169-8c369cd8d1ee"}],"slug":"momotaro-matsuri-ishikawa-rokuemon-no-maki","summary":"Playstation festival RPG","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/momotaro-matsuri-ishikawa-rokuemon-no-maki"},{"id":20816,"cover":{"id":28325,"game":20816,"height":974,"image_id":"pbfaodpv26pdwkc8s1z4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pbfaodpv26pdwkc8s1z4.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"9c0c7c59-b5ce-833f-8142-94df86f6c2ca"},"first_release_date":862444800,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"BRAHMA Force: The Assault on Beltlogger 9","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99073,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":862444800,"game":20816,"human":"May 01, 1997","m":5,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1997,"checksum":"c4df3af2-9865-9350-f9eb-3e1d2f50615d"}],"slug":"brahma-force-the-assault-on-beltlogger-9","summary":"A mech-based FPS; pilot your Bipedal Robotic Assault Heavy Mechanized Armor (built by Bronx Industries, of course) through the Beltlogger 9 excavation colony... \n \n...discover what happened to the Beltlogger 9 colony- it may be related to the events on Probe Ship Mina 3, wherein a lone person apparently under the control of an outside intelligence slaughtered his shipmates.","total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/brahma-force-the-assault-on-beltlogger-9"},{"id":43856,"collection":{"id":4133,"created_at":1507852800,"games":[3369,43856],"name":"Bottom of the 9th","slug":"bottom-of-the-9th","updated_at":1507852800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/bottom-of-the-9th","checksum":"c2cf9bf7-9963-ec7f-b021-7668d5054f1f"},"cover":{"id":41038,"game":43856,"height":640,"image_id":"egey6dmx4gipoge9ankb","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/egey6dmx4gipoge9ankb.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"e76abb43-25a5-fbde-b9ec-7e390b2cf65a"},"first_release_date":904521600,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Bottom of the 9th '99","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":88985,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":906940800,"game":43856,"human":"Sep 28, 1998","m":9,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":1998,"checksum":"83223f79-cf1d-01ba-b063-d33007c5033f"},{"id":121140,"category":0,"created_at":1508025600,"date":904521600,"game":43856,"human":"Aug 31, 1998","m":8,"platform":7,"region":2,"updated_at":1508025600,"y":1998,"checksum":"8210ec2a-f8ac-878b-a930-6fe6aca1c483"}],"slug":"bottom-of-the-9th-99","summary":"BOTTOM OF THE 9TH ‘99 brings all of the action and excitement of professional baseball to the PlayStation.

It all begins when the youngsters hear rumors about spirits contained in the school building. At night, Yuri and her friends go into the school and play a spirit-summoning game. Suddenly, real ghosts appear and scare the teenagers away. The next day, Yuri is almost ready to believe it was all a dream... but naturally it wasn't. The dark secrets of the lost souls are going to be revealed only to those which possess a special sense - the Twilight Syndrome.. \n \nThe third entry in the Twilight Syndrome series is also a horror adventure, sharing most gameplay elements with its predecessors. The gameplay here is very minimalistic: the player can navigate the 3D models of the heroes (several characters can be controlled at once, as a group) through the limited areas (also rendered in 3D), searching for clues and escaping from danger. There is no other interaction, no usable items, and no combat. \n \nDialogue and action choices will pop out during many situations. Some of these choices do not influence the narrative, while others might change the following dialogue, and also lead the young heroes to premature death. \n \nAn additional gameplay mode (beside the story mode) is free-roaming exploration for Yuri, who can explore the school and its surroundings at night and gather more stories from the ghosts she encounters.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/twilight-syndrome-saikai"},{"id":44906,"cover":{"id":65202,"game":44906,"height":500,"image_id":"xytj8tqr4nfyzypez42g","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xytj8tqr4nfyzypez42g.jpg","width":351,"checksum":"17b990cb-e164-b9c8-2603-b3ddb28f3f83"},"first_release_date":996451200,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"name":"TechnoMage: Return of Eternity","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99395,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":996451200,"game":44906,"human":"Jul 30, 2001","m":7,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":2001,"checksum":"c4e7de78-213a-9888-dbd7-df9425a938d8"}],"slug":"technomage-return-of-eternity","summary":"Enter into an action-packed and thrilling adventure!

The game allows the player to command teammates to attack or follow the player's main vehicle.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wargames-defcon-1"},{"id":10917,"collection":{"id":1455,"created_at":1433203200,"games":[2164,10917,10918,43749],"name":"The Neverhood","slug":"the-neverhood","updated_at":1433203200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/the-neverhood","checksum":"349f511a-dfb3-aedc-4c38-e771686b067e"},"cover":{"id":77943,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":10917,"height":487,"image_id":"co1o53","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1o53.jpg","width":365,"checksum":"5aa99c5e-becd-53cd-cb6d-c6020f37e04c"},"first_release_date":886204800,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":24049,"company":{"id":1017,"name":"The Neverhood, Inc.","slug":"the-neverhood-inc"}},{"id":24050,"company":{"id":850,"logo":{"id":410,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":251,"image_id":"le72tei8x7cl2hb3jhms","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/le72tei8x7cl2hb3jhms.jpg","width":399,"checksum":"018ce971-34a1-9bc8-5c64-6a2a3fddd813"},"name":"Dreamworks Interactive","slug":"dreamworks-interactive"}},{"id":24051,"company":{"id":1,"description":"Electronic Arts Inc. is a leading global interactive entertainment software company.

It was also released on the Sega Saturn. \n \nThis compilation includes the classic games: \n \n- Konami's Tennis (1984): \nReleased in 1984, Konami's Tennis plays much like Atari's Realsports Tennis but with ladies instead of men. The game can be played by one player against the CPU, two player singles or two player doubles. A referee in the tower tells whether the ball is in or not. Serving and shooting is a simple matter of timing against the 3D animated ball, and you need not worry whether it is to the left or right of your player. Certain features uncommon at the time, such as net balls and a ball fetching boy, are also supported. \n \n- Konami's Soccer (1985): \nSoccer is an action game for two players or one player against the computer. You can play the game in one of five skill levels, choose from several different teams, and select the amount of time the match will take. Soccer features throw-ins, goal kicks, corner kicks, penalty kicks and an overhead view of the field which scrolls to follow the action. \n \n- Konami Rally (1985): \nA basic racing game in which you have to finish within the time limit and reach the finish with a given ranking. You 'll start as the last driver in the field and you will have to fight your way forward by over taking your competitors. The number of cars you 'll have to pass will increase each stage. The car has two gears, low and high and tends to slip in curves. \n \n- Comic Bakery (1984): \nA baker tries to bake and deliver bread while fighting raccoons. Pieces of bread are moving along a factory line. The raccoons try to eat your bread and also try to switch off your machines. You have to keep your machinery running and also scaring away the raccoons. If you do that your delivery truck will be loaded with bread and drive off. \n \n- Pippols (1985): \nA young farmer go in search of the pipul, the sacred tree of Buddah, to get the jewel that is hidden inside of it (a rare flower) and take it back to his home. \n \n- King's Valley (1985): \nKing's Valley is a puzzle game in which you need to collect all the treasures by drilling and cutting your way through the pyramids. But beware of the mummies that haunt the pyramids. If you use the limited available cutting and drilling equipment in the wrong order you'll eventually get stuck. You'll then have to play the whole level over again. \n \n- Penguin Adventure (1986): \nPenguin Adventure: the main character - a male penguin - must save the penguin princess from a sickness that has spread across the penguin world. The cure to the sickness can be found in the Golden Apple of the Golden Apple Tree. In this action packed game, you take control of the male penguin and travel across the lands and seas in search of the Golden Apple, fighting different types of enemies including bats, thunder-striking clouds, and environmental obstacles such as rocks, until finally reaching the princess. The stages feature different types of landscapes such as forests, mountains, caves, and water stages. As you fight your way through, you can also catch flying fish which you can trade at the different types of shops for new equipments and a weapon. \n \n- Time Pilot (1983): \nTime Pilot is an arcade style shooter. Piloting your trusty spaceship, you need to destroy the squadrons of enemy craft that are attacking! On each level you have a quota of enemies that need to be destroyed. After fulfilling your quota, a final boss of the level will appear; when destroyed, you will move on to the next level. The game begins in the year 1910, and each time a level is completed you advance in time. In 1910 you only have to face relatively unarmed biplanes, but as the levels advance so does the technology. Each new level brings with it tougher, more heavily armed aircraft including jets, helicopters, and even flying saucers! From time to time, you will encounter a parachute; if you run into this, you will earn bonus points. \n \n- Parodius (1987): \nThis is mostly the parody of Gradius (Nemesis on some systems), with some flavor from other shoot-em-ups, like Twinbee. The series is available on numerous platforms. The game is a right-to-left scrolling shoot-em-up. You can choose from 4 different flying creatures, with different weapons. You must finish 7 stages, each having a boss at the end. You may start at either one, but must complete every level to advance to the final stage. \n \n- Salamander (1987): \nIn a distant part of the universe, an alien creature called Zelos was born. As he grew so did his appetite, and soon he began devouring galaxies, planets, and stars by the hundreds. Now your planet has appeared in Zelos' path, and it is up to you and a partner to fly into battle to save your world. Life Force is an action packed shooter based on the arcade game. There are six levels which alternate between side and vertical scrolling, each of them ending with a powerful guardian. Throughout the game, destroying certain enemies will release power ups which can be used to equip your ship with more powerful weapons, extra speed, and shields.

This provokes much jealousy in Asuka, who also suspects that Kirishima is a spy who is trying to get information from Shinji about NERV and the Evas. Rei Ayanami is present but plays a rather background role in the story, though she seems to agree with the suspicions of Asuka. Gradually, a relationship between Mana and Shinji unfolds and they end up going on a date. It turns out, however, that Mana is one of three test pilots for the TRIDENT (alternatively named the \"Country Crawler\") units, a new competitor to the Evangelions, similar to Jet Alone; thus the name Girlfriend of Steel. Eventually, the TRIDENT goes berserk and the Evas have to destroy it. \n \nThe interactivity in most of the game is limited to walking around areas until the next plot event is triggered. However, the one true branch occurs at the end of the game, where the player may choose to focus on Mana, Asuka or Kaji. This choice determines which of the game's three endings are shown, with a fourth exclusive to the PS2. \n \nIn the Mana ending, Mana is discovered not to have been killed in the battle. Shinji rescues her and brings her back to his apartment. She showers, emerges wearing only a towel, and teasingly asks Shinji if he would like her to remove it (which she eventually does). In discussion with Misato, however, it is agreed that Mana has to leave Tokyo-3, and she says a teary goodbye to Shinji who has won her heart. \n \nIn the Asuka ending, Asuka helps Shinji to get over Mana and the two children grow closer as a result. This ending contains romantic images of Asuka and Shinji together, including a moving scene where Asuka hugs Shinji emotionally. \n \nThe third ending with Kaji does not focus on any one character as much as the other endings do. Mana is also discovered not to be killed, and says goodbye, with Shinji replying \"I'll be waiting for you\".","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/neon-genesis-evangelion-koutetsu-no-girlfriend"},{"id":44950,"first_release_date":978048000,"name":"Dragon Tales: Dragon Seek","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99306,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":978048000,"game":44950,"human":"Dec 29, 2000","m":12,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":2000,"checksum":"b06b3cfc-d481-7171-09d1-786d2ba047a6"}],"slug":"dragon-tales-dragon-seek","summary":"Dragon Tales: Dragon Seek is an interactive product that is part of the encompassing multi-media project centered on the PBS television series Dragon Tales.

The main character and several enemies were designed by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. \n \nbut to his horror two aliens in spacecraft appear and chase him down the corridor. \n \nRascal finally makes it to his father's lab by going through the safe door entrance. He is shocked to find Chronon, the evil master of time, torturing his dad for unknown reasons, and holding him at gunpoint with another of his dad's inventions called the \"Bubble Gun\", but Chronon accidentally activates the controls for the time machine and he and the Professor are sucked into the time portal. The Bubble Gun manages to be released from the portal and lands at the feet of Rascal, who picks it up, vowing to save his dad. \n \nRascal chases the two through time, from the medieval Castle Hackalott, to the Aztec Temple at Chichimeca, to the lost city of Atlantis, to the Jolly Raider pirate ship and Dodgy City in the old West, travelling to each location's past and present forms and collecting the pieces of a Time Clock from both before fighting Chronon in each area's future. Afterwards Rascal travels to the Corridors of Time, Chronon's lair within the space-time continuum where, after defeating its guardians brought from each of the other time periods, he successfully defeats Chronon and rescues his dad. After escaping using another time portal, Rascal and his dad safely return home, leaving the portal to shatter and trap Chronon in interdimensional time forever. \n \nGameplay \nIn the game, the player assumes the role of Rascal armed with the Bubble Gun, in a mission through five worlds involving a medieval castle, ancient Aztec ruins, the aquatic city of Atlantis, a pirate ship and a Western town.[1] Each world has three forms: past, present, and future[1] (e.g. Castle Hackalott appears as a medieval castle in the past where in the present day, it has become a museum). \n \nThe player needs only to complete the past level to gain access to the next world. In each past and present level, the player has to find the six pieces of the Time Clock in order to access the Time Bubble at the end and be able to access the next form of that world. Each future level has a boss fight against Chronon. Defeating him in all five gives access to the final world. The Bubble Gun has limited ammo, and which bubbles it shoots depends on how much ammo is left.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rascal"},{"id":78144,"cover":{"id":59943,"game":78144,"height":443,"image_id":"lz3kcynsoz8gkszxqegb","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lz3kcynsoz8gkszxqegb.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"21279961-21a6-f7e8-0d98-09c948457b5d"},"first_release_date":891475200,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":59005,"company":{"id":1394,"logo":{"id":1304,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":60,"image_id":"tmdlhmvvqwgqms3o9xnc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tmdlhmvvqwgqms3o9xnc.jpg","width":200,"checksum":"55c6202c-f3a2-5e25-4356-fd3547fe4e5a"},"name":"Omega Force","slug":"omega-force"}},{"id":59006,"company":{"id":630,"logo":{"id":1305,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":190,"image_id":"ex1qj9juw4fssixmzi7u","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ex1qj9juw4fssixmzi7u.jpg","width":420,"checksum":"4281916b-400a-5a8c-1217-9665b4cf1b34"},"name":"Koei","slug":"koei"}}],"name":"Enigma","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":131256,"category":0,"created_at":1513209600,"date":891475200,"game":78144,"human":"Apr 02, 1998","m":4,"platform":7,"region":5,"updated_at":1513209600,"y":1998,"checksum":"7559d54c-e9ee-eeff-32d6-3c50c2ab7cd5"}],"screenshots":[{"id":352209,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":78144,"height":480,"image_id":"sc7jrl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7jrl.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"42e94a66-1d19-3d1f-c60b-2e68c7464c88"},{"id":352210,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":78144,"height":480,"image_id":"sc7jrm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7jrm.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"d2ef8957-e09a-95d5-6671-45454b282c5c"},{"id":352211,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":78144,"height":480,"image_id":"sc7jrn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7jrn.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"9be73a57-f756-5e70-1b4e-ad16f164bc4a"},{"id":352212,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":78144,"height":480,"image_id":"sc7jro","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7jro.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"73200445-e1ba-092b-a3a6-2e1c3b1ab001"}],"slug":"enigma--1","summary":"Enigma is a 1998 Japanese video game for the Sony PlayStation.

When risen to the highest extent, you can unleash your ultimate. Within this game, three different buttons vary from a weak attack, or a more stronger attack. The combo system seems to range up to the max of 10 in battle. Story mode, Vs mode, and Arcade mode are the three playable modes within this game. In Story mode, you will experience various cutscenes and additional minigames. Arcade mode seems to be the same except for the fact that you will be continuously battling. Of course within Vs mode, you can battle against a friend or a com. Overall within this game, 17 characters are playable (3 of which being different versions of Yoh). It is known that Hao can also be playable, but a Gameshark code is needed. Fortunately, as well within battle, character voices will be experienced rather commonly, in which anime cutscenes will be experienced at times - such as in the intro. Overall, it seems that Shaman King: Spirit of Shamans is the best 2D fighter of its series.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shaman-king-spirit-of-shamans"},{"id":77250,"collection":{"id":793,"created_at":1392163200,"games":[4501,5398,5399,77250],"name":"Lethal Enforcers","slug":"lethal-enforcers","updated_at":1392163200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/lethal-enforcers","checksum":"2a5e80ab-d93d-a4c0-a2d9-fec8f8c88b2f"},"cover":{"id":72430,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":77250,"height":814,"image_id":"co1jvy","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1jvy.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"a58d384e-be85-b40c-0ca2-cfb6889e713a"},"first_release_date":883526400,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":94407,"company":{"id":129,"description":"Konami Holdings Corporation, commonly referred to as Konami, is a Japanese entertainment and gaming conglomerate.

New twists on the classic gameplay include the ability to bounce the ball over barriers as well as earn a special power-up by scoring a certain number of points.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/blockids"},{"id":43877,"collection":{"id":1703,"created_at":1442966400,"games":[838,12905,18333,43877,46372,47362],"name":"Pro Pinball","slug":"pro-pinball","updated_at":1442966400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/pro-pinball","checksum":"ca4677c0-1130-8633-0f02-9ef44b1595da"},"cover":{"id":101169,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":43877,"height":834,"image_id":"co2629","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2629.jpg","width":626,"checksum":"ba976bd7-5e2d-c943-25a5-28dbcc5a96e8"},"first_release_date":966211200,"genres":[{"id":30,"created_at":1320192000,"name":"Pinball","slug":"pinball","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/pinball","checksum":"b5657d72-ee36-0851-58df-e8d2413283f8"}],"name":"Pro Pinball: Fantastic Journey","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":88977,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":966211200,"game":43877,"human":"Aug 14, 2000","m":8,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":2000,"checksum":"ae886938-e3dc-a9be-a5ec-3f1a39a124ce"}],"slug":"pro-pinball-fantastic-journey","summary":"Roll up!

Players with the ball can aim right, left, high, or low. Thrown balls can be caught by the opposing team, which awards them points. These points can then be used to implement special throws such as the grenade, boomerang, and the screwdriver, making the balls more difficult to avoid or catch. Options include adjustable time limits for Single Matches and three levels of difficulty.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/all-star-slammin-d-ball"},{"id":43723,"first_release_date":882316800,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"name":"K-1 The Arena Fighters","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":89098,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":882316800,"game":43723,"human":"Dec 17, 1997","m":12,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":1997,"checksum":"4697acda-d44c-e696-5a70-666c858cb082"}],"slug":"k-1-the-arena-fighters","summary":"All of the punches, kicks, knockouts, and general brutality of kickboxing have come to the PlayStation with K-1 THE ARENA FIGHTERS.

Much like the classic story, THE GRINCH takes place in the idyllic Whoville--where your aim is to cease the event called Christmas. You attempt to do so by wreaking havoc and solving challenging puzzles. The folks of Whoville will try to stop your efforts with love and happiness (blech!), so be on your toes if you hope to avoid them and effectively ruin the holiday. To make things a little easier, you can throw snowballs at the peacenik villagers to keep them at a distance. Each level will present new obstacles and challenges, and the Dr. Seuss world is faithfully translated to the video game format. Whether you're a genuine grouch or you're just in the mood for a great adventure, THE GRINCH is hilarious fun for everyone.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-grinch"},{"id":15477,"cover":{"id":98217,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":15477,"height":800,"image_id":"co23s9","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co23s9.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"909dcb8b-8fab-6785-963d-0089f67a2165"},"first_release_date":849398400,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":11,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","slug":"real-time-strategy-rts","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/real-time-strategy-rts","checksum":"aaa36cbc-2258-8653-a461-1358df8ce445"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":72473,"company":{"id":1193,"name":"Synthetic Dimensions","slug":"synthetic-dimensions"}},{"id":72474,"company":{"id":764,"logo":{"id":244,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":188,"image_id":"jzat4lzichs6b5oa1ptu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jzat4lzichs6b5oa1ptu.jpg","width":250,"checksum":"0075b068-3738-4f31-d257-8bc4a11b0aa0"},"name":"Psygnosis","slug":"psygnosis"}}],"name":"Chronicles Of The Sword","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99272,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":849398400,"game":15477,"human":"Dec 01, 1996","m":12,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1996,"checksum":"aee59706-00bd-1f4a-3385-a822fd94dbec"}],"slug":"chronicles-of-the-sword","summary":"Join the quest for a united Camelot.\n\nTo serve King Arthur.

These tiles are then placed into rows on a board made up of 225 spaces. Each letter is worth a certain point value, and some of the spaces will offer specific bonuses if you manage to build off them. The player with the most points after all the tiles have been placed on the board is considered the winner. The PlayStation version follows this same format, but with automatic scoring and a computer opponent named Maven with eight selectable difficulty levels.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/scrabble-crossword-game"},{"id":6881,"cover":{"id":7046,"game":6881,"height":300,"image_id":"zsmkrlztrqakmo2acui8","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zsmkrlztrqakmo2acui8.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"202d4631-6aed-c0e0-2c34-36e79cf65a79"},"first_release_date":688867200,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":16275,"company":{"id":2931,"name":"Candle Light Studios","slug":"candle-light-studios"}},{"id":16276,"company":{"id":1145,"name":"Telstar Electronic Studios Ltd.","slug":"telstar-electronic-studios-ltd"}},{"id":16277,"company":{"id":327,"description":"Midway Games was an American video game company dedicated to the developing and publishing of video games.

It was released only in Japan and was also the only one in the series not to feature a Pac-Man game. \nThe limited edition comes in a large box designed to hold all 6 Namco Museum releases as well as a memory card. \n \nIt features 7 titles: \n \n- Dragon Saber (1990): A vertical scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1990. It is the sequel to Dragon Spirit, released 3 years earlier. \nSTORY: The human beings have repeated their own foolish history, because of their own desires. And everything around then has amounted to come to nothing. Advanced alchemy has caused environmental disruption. The world has been filled with evil creatures. And the human beings have threatened with extinction. Meanwhile, the sun god, Amaterasu appeared from the sky to human, and told. \"The brave young man Huey and Siria. I grant you this sacred saber.\" \"Show your good spirit!\" \n \n- Wonder Momo (1987): A beat 'em up arcade game that was released exclusively in Japan by Namco in 1987. It runs on Namco System 86 hardware, and was later ported to the PC-Engine in 1989. It is Namco's last 8-bit arcade game. This game was never released outside of Japan, probably because of its slightly questionable content. Momo is a young girl who gets super-powers, hence becoming Wonder Momo and battling costumed villains. \n \n- Rompers (1989): an arcade game that was released by Namco in 1989 only in Japan. It runs on Namco System 1 hardware. \nYou control a guy wearing a straw hat named Chap who must collect all of the keys in 61 maze-like gardens while avoiding various enemies to rescue his girlfriend, Rumina. He can push the walls over to crush the enemies, but they will come back as eggs which will hatch after a few seconds. There is also a strict time limit to ensure you don't dawdle. \n \n- Motos (1985): An arcade game that was released by Namco in 1985. It runs on Namco Super Pac-Man hardware but with a video system like that used in Mappy. It has 62 levels. \nThe player must maneuver a bumper car to bump enemies off the edge of the playfield while they attempt to do the same to it. Power-ups give the car extra bumping power and the ability to jump over gaps in the playfield. \n \n- Sky Kid (1985): A horizontal scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1985. It runs on Namco Pac-Land hardware but with a video system like that used in Dragon Buster. It is also the first game from Namco to allow 2 players to play simultaneously. The game was later released on the Famicom (brought to the American NES by Sunsoft), and this version was released on Nintendo's Virtual Console service in North America on May 19, 2008 at a cost of 500 Wii Points. A sequel named Sky Kid Deluxe was released in 1986. It introduced several new enemies and missions. \nThe players play as the Sky Kids \"Red Baron\" and \"Blue Max\", which are references to Manfred von Richthofen, the famous World War I flying ace, and the prestigious order Pour le Mérite, informally known as Blue Max. The Sky Kids fly around in biplanes and are assigned specific targets during the missions. These missions involve bombing specific targets. \n \n- King & Balloon (1980): A fixed shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1980. It runs on Namco Galaxian hardware but with an extra Z80 processor to drive a DAC for speech; the King speaks when he is captured (\"HELP!\"), when he is rescued (\"Thank you\"), and when he is carried away (\"BYE BYE!\"). Additionally, the balloons make the same \"droning\" sound as the ships in Galaxian, which was released the previous year. The player's shots also have the same sound effect as the player ship in said game. \nThe player controls two green men (likely soldiers in the king's army) with an orange cannon that fires at squads of descending balloons. You must protect the king and prevent him from being captured and carried away by one of the balloons. \n \n- Rolling Thunder (1986): A run and gun arcade game that was released by Namco in 1986.

Power-ups can also be purchased between stages in order to better equip oneself for precarious situations that may lie ahead.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sorcerers-maze"},{"id":1731,"collection":{"id":337,"created_at":1351987200,"games":[1714,1715,1716,1717,1718,1719,1720,1721,1722,1723,1724,1725,1726,1727,1728,1730,1731,1732,1733,1734,1735,1736,1737,1738,1739,1740,1788,10614,12937,42201,45190,48593,57232,64138,66918,76723,78132,80225,124033,132024],"name":"Mega Man","slug":"mega-man","updated_at":1351987200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/mega-man","checksum":"8647a35f-4226-0cbd-7f5a-a4ed5ccd114c"},"cover":{"id":93349,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":1731,"height":800,"image_id":"co2011","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2011.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"865fa130-d553-c2c1-cfcd-f75858f03a33"},"first_release_date":858816000,"franchises":[{"id":38,"created_at":1351987200,"games":[1714,1715,1716,1717,1718,1719,1720,1721,1722,1723,1724,1725,1726,1727,1728,1729,1730,1731,1732,1733,1734,1735,1736,1737,1738,1739,1740,1741,1742,1743,1744,1745,1746,1747,1748,1749,1750,1751,1752,1753,1754,1755,1756,1757,1758,1759,1760,1761,1762,1763,1764,1765,1766,1767,1768,1769,1771,1772,1774,1775,1776,1777,1778,1779,1780,1781,1782,1783,1784,1785,1786,1787,1788,4001,6184,6864,8246,8247,9721,12937,19874,24275,24355,27306,28323,44016,45184,45190,76723,87782,89877,96248,96252,96254,102716,110814,120484,121045,122048,124033,125157,134078],"name":"Mega Man","slug":"mega-man","updated_at":1351987200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/mega-man","checksum":"fae0fc68-1636-93ac-99cf-65a7e29c9c21"}],"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"name":"Mega Man Battle & Chase","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":32116,"category":0,"created_at":1439078400,"date":858816000,"game":1731,"human":"Mar 20, 1997","m":3,"platform":7,"region":5,"updated_at":1439078400,"y":1997,"checksum":"266ded46-83a0-09d1-794a-956cd0aa0283"}],"slug":"mega-man-battle-chase","summary":"It's robot mayhem at the Battle & Chase tournament!

Meeting up with four other unique warriors along the way (the droid-like Harv-5, a magical floating head named Xero Von Moon, a cyborg-like Gadgeteer called Clemett and Wyldern-native Jirina), the group strives to seek out and destroy the source of Arkose's destruction. \n \nIn classic RPG style, they'll confront evil minions through random encounters, avoidable if the party hides quickly enough upon hearing the wild sounds of the enemy. After each successful encounter, the party is rewarded with experience points, often accompanied by gold and items useful to its journey. Once characters have enough experience points, they advance in level, increasing such abilities as attack strength, defense, agility (ability to evade attacks), prowess (ability to strike hits) and speed (how often they can attack).","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shadow-madness"},{"id":43871,"cover":{"id":90464,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":43871,"height":472,"image_id":"co1xsw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1xsw.jpg","width":466,"checksum":"bf024b31-9e92-cbb2-e50b-b9276111db33"},"first_release_date":933292800,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":91663,"company":{"id":213,"description":"Infogrames Entertainment, SA  was an international French holding company headquartered in Lyon, France.

The game was created as a spiritual sequel to Fire Emblem by the game's creator, Shouzou Kaga, who no longer had the rights to the Fire Emblem IP upon leaving Intelligent Systems and Nintendo. The game shares the same interface, graphical and music style, and overall gameflow. The game involves the player moving characters in a turn based fashion across a large grid from an top-down perspective. The player is tasked with certain objectives, commonly fighting and defeating an entire opposing faction, or a particular member or leader of a faction. \n \nThere are two protagonists in the game, Runan and Holmes, each with their own army to command. Though the two armies travel separately for the majority of the game, the cross paths at several point of the story, allowing the player to switch allocations of fighters and items amongst the two groups. Runan's story follows a strict set of scenarios where he battles against an enemy empire, while Holme's scenario allows for more freedom, allowing the player to ignore the main scenarios in favor of gathering treasure and increase the army's strength. \n \n \nThe game takes place on an island continent called Riberia, which had long been divided and ruled under four kingdoms. However, these kingdoms were destroyed by the evil Zoa Empire and its devil-worshipping ruler, and the island was starting to regress into a period of instability and darkness. The Rīve Kingdom was one of the four kingdoms of Riberia, and the first protagonist, Runan (リュナン Ryunan?), is the prince of Razelia; one of the principalities within the kingdom. After the fall of his father's principality, he escaped and went into hiding in a nearby port-town. However, this town also fell into the hands of the Empire, and Runan and Holmes (ホームズ?), the prince of another one of the kingdom's principalities, retreat to the newly created Uelt Kingdom with a small contingent of troops. The two receive assistance from the Uelt king, and begin a long journey to destroy the evil empire.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tear-ring-saga"},{"id":45024,"cover":{"id":53348,"game":45024,"height":1365,"image_id":"teph7788duwqkdniqf11","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/teph7788duwqkdniqf11.jpg","width":1409,"checksum":"43008fca-d729-37da-46bf-bf9d2c69a930"},"first_release_date":971827200,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":11,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","slug":"real-time-strategy-rts","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/real-time-strategy-rts","checksum":"aaa36cbc-2258-8653-a461-1358df8ce445"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":81346,"company":{"id":18808,"name":"SIE London Studios","slug":"sie-london-studios"}},{"id":81347,"company":{"id":327,"description":"Midway Games was an American video game company dedicated to the developing and publishing of video games.

The levels differ from town exploring, to bottle-shooting in a bar, to freeing hostages on the roof of train, to Indian sneaking. But, all of them lead Lucky to $1,000,000 for the capture of the Daltons.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/lucky-luke"},{"id":28090,"collection":{"id":3819,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[6299,28090,44848,49868,70235,72539,78842,83248],"name":"Action Man","slug":"action-man","updated_at":1507766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/action-man","checksum":"c23417fb-a4d0-f106-8cdb-3f70b5fe87a3"},"cover":{"id":104988,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":28090,"height":800,"image_id":"co290c","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co290c.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"f4b8d5f9-95dc-58e3-ad34-40c523eb66a7"},"first_release_date":961891200,"franchises":[{"id":396,"created_at":1398038400,"games":[6299,28090],"name":"Action Man","slug":"action-man","updated_at":1398038400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/action-man","checksum":"f265af85-54e0-fa9f-3b02-064bb8ee1d9c"}],"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":45816,"company":{"id":1286,"name":"Blitz Games","slug":"blitz-games"}},{"id":45817,"company":{"id":183,"name":"Hasbro Interactive","slug":"hasbro-interactive"}}],"name":"Action Man: Operation Extreme","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":67905,"category":0,"created_at":1491436800,"date":973641600,"game":28090,"human":"Nov 08, 2000","m":11,"platform":7,"region":2,"updated_at":1491436800,"y":2000,"checksum":"cee58328-d215-2192-3c23-f06e52e8a3fb"},{"id":67906,"category":0,"created_at":1491436800,"date":961891200,"game":28090,"human":"Jun 25, 2000","m":6,"platform":7,"region":1,"updated_at":1491436800,"y":2000,"checksum":"d24f8aa8-7d96-2108-93dd-0efde51226df"}],"screenshots":[{"id":41044,"game":28090,"height":600,"image_id":"duvqctmuv3tpnmrydyyn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/duvqctmuv3tpnmrydyyn.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"21a9d610-916d-8b4d-0375-250627b0acbb"},{"id":41045,"game":28090,"height":796,"image_id":"hclz13tjbgqevf9zrvgd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hclz13tjbgqevf9zrvgd.jpg","width":1056,"checksum":"4add2a41-b351-1281-2969-617bfc438661"},{"id":41046,"game":28090,"height":636,"image_id":"d5ima3yhmhtmm1bd6u4d","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/d5ima3yhmhtmm1bd6u4d.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"f595b957-7a73-2313-3d74-6f4d63c1966e"},{"id":41047,"game":28090,"height":768,"image_id":"yrjqtfwbu1le2gjmvl6a","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yrjqtfwbu1le2gjmvl6a.jpg","width":1024,"checksum":"05b6ea05-540a-34ec-69a3-d1c1265ad20f"},{"id":41048,"game":28090,"height":720,"image_id":"p3kipq0bzkrlc5mdqilo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p3kipq0bzkrlc5mdqilo.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"8c8aaff7-bc1a-c2f8-d28d-47166fe79a6b"}],"slug":"action-man-operation-extreme","summary":"Action Man: Operation Extreme features two different gameplay modes that you switch back and forth from during the course of play.

It is Compile's last recognized Puyo Puyo title in the series before Sega obtained the rights. \nPuyo Puyo Box, being a compilation, primarily consists of modes from earlier Puyo Puyo games, but also contains original content. \n \nThis game has a plethora of game modes available to the user. It contains ports of \"Puyo Puyo\" and \"Puyo Puyo 2\", as well as a RPG-styled quest mode in which the player plays as Arle and battles against members of the other cast in Puyo Puyo matches. It also houses a \"Stage Clear\" mode in which you have to face either 10, 20, or 30 opponents, as well as two multiplayer modes which can be played with either other players or AI substitutes. \n \nFor the Quest mode itself, it allowed the player to customize the armory in ways in which made Arle stronger with a double-edged sword effect. You could remove the Puyo Rings in order to beef up her attack at the expense of being unable to see your next pieces for example, and the amount of experience gained and gold won was relative to how big a chain was scored and how quickly the opponent was defeated. \n \nThe key point in the Puyo Puyo gameplay of Box is that the player can choose a ruleset from either \"Puyo Puyo\", \"Puyo Puyo 2\", \"Puyo Puyo Sun\" and \"Puyo Puyo~n\". This can effectively lead to 4-player battles where each player plays with independent or mixed rules. This game also allowed for team battles to take place. A special multiplayer mode was made available in this game, known as \"Treasure Mode\", which was adapted in \"Puyo Puyo! 15th Anniversary\" as its \"Excavation Mode\".","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/puyo-puyo-box"},{"id":20430,"collection":{"id":2258,"created_at":1468627200,"games":[20428,20429,20430,20431,20432,20433,20434],"name":"NHL FaceOff","slug":"nhl-faceoff","updated_at":1468627200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/nhl-faceoff","checksum":"374ce10a-dabd-433a-1c97-898819e5489b"},"cover":{"id":54507,"game":20430,"height":518,"image_id":"mubgepinhw8xovv5fpoi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mubgepinhw8xovv5fpoi.jpg","width":537,"checksum":"e5b7068f-c9c0-ef45-f5d2-20a7a0b8a0e4"},"first_release_date":877651200,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"NHL FaceOff 98","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":89021,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":877651200,"game":20430,"human":"Oct 24, 1997","m":10,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":1997,"checksum":"65693f90-8a79-c604-42aa-b037a0bbd5df"}],"slug":"nhl-faceoff-98","summary":"NHL FaceOff 98 is a Sports game, developed by Killer Game and published by SCEA, which was released in 1997.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nhl-faceoff-98"},{"id":22833,"collection":{"id":529,"created_at":1374537600,"games":[2702,3417,3440,3441,5732,6307,6308,8498,22830,22833,26819,27454,43554,43947,43948,43949,44994,47694,47721,49314,49954,50582,73898,75693],"name":"Army Men","slug":"army-men","updated_at":1374537600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/army-men","checksum":"0b318335-32ec-703e-7bd0-5ac550135d4d"},"cover":{"id":54561,"game":22833,"height":636,"image_id":"ws1lvpmhbsxrd19wm05t","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ws1lvpmhbsxrd19wm05t.jpg","width":548,"checksum":"f127f201-bf5b-def4-5795-42c24abf9dbc"},"first_release_date":922579200,"name":"Army Men 3D","platforms":[7],"rating":65.5551018474994,"rating_count":6,"release_dates":[{"id":99188,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":922579200,"game":22833,"human":"Mar 28, 1999","m":3,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1999,"checksum":"2b0be030-ecff-2989-0fae-fc60b54ac27a"}],"slug":"army-men-3d","summary":"The little plastic army men you played with as a child are toys no longer!

The events of the game take place between the second and the upcoming third game, and fill the story gap between them. The story centers on the rebellion that has taken place in the Grasslands. It has been three months since the end of the Dunan Unification Wars. A legend telling about the Fire Brigands lead by the mysterious Fire Champion who united the Grassland nations is being spread around.

The main computer of the self-sufficient space colony Utopia, called St. Schutz, has gone haywire. The goal of the game is to escape from Utopia. \n \nThe game plays very differently from a normal space shooter. Each \"floor\" is made up of a series of interconnected rooms, and the player can choose any room adjacent to one they've cleared. For each adjacent room the player has cleared, their firepower in that room will be greater. Each floor has a number of boss rooms with a much larger and more dangerous enemy, each of which must be cleared to complete the floor. There is also a stronger power weapon which will recharge after use. \n \nAll the while, a strict timer is counting down. When the player gets hit, instead of dying or taking damage, they lose time on the timer. The only way to get more time is to defeat a boss, so the player must balance between clearing rooms for greater firepower, and clearing bosses for more time.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sanvein"},{"id":43903,"collection":{"id":4649,"created_at":1512777600,"games":[43903,76591],"name":"Marl

It is a 1-2 player game, and each race has 2 characters running (1 in certain game modes). The game was released 4 months after Rayman M/Arena. \n \nRaces take place on 12 tracks in four worlds and there are five main modes of play: Training, Championship, Time Attack, Lum, and Target. Some of the modes of play in Rayman Rush concern more combative contests, as opposed to straightforward racing. Success allows players to unlock new characters and play modes. Two Rayman Rush players can race head-to-head, split-screen style.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rayman-rush"},{"id":20253,"cover":{"id":22450,"game":20253,"height":800,"image_id":"o7g6oqekd5bmie2di4ee","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o7g6oqekd5bmie2di4ee.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"9abeac2a-6a14-b6d6-4a4e-7128b6ee4998"},"first_release_date":854668800,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"name":"The Raven Project","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":89140,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":854668800,"game":20253,"human":"Jan 31, 1997","m":1,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":1997,"checksum":"dee1c8fe-ea77-c156-e648-5142ddeeda93"}],"slug":"the-raven-project","summary":"[SLES_00039] (CD1) and [SLES_10039] (CD2) \nSci-fi shooter with gameplay similar to the Rebel Assault series.

Synthetic lifeforms are considered second class citizens by their human counterparts. The story takes place on the prison planet Alpha Prime, a world completely designed for the holding of criminals. You are a synthetic lifeform sentenced for an eternity for a crime you didn't commit and in order to earn your freedom, you must compete against other prisoners in competitions in 10 different incarceration facilities. To compete in these competitions however, you must undergo a procedure that removes your legs and replaces it with a rolling sphere. \n \nThere are seven different events to compete in which are Pursuit, Last Man Rolling, Race, King of the Hill, Run the Gauntlet, Tag, and Powerball that pit you not only against your fellow inmates and guards, but against the levels themselves. Run the gauntlet charges you with making it to a goal point within a time limit, all the while avoiding other warriors and obstacles such as flame throwers, spikes, and gun turrets. Pursuit is identical, but it adds the challenge of the arena crumbling away. Powerball has you collecting balls throughout the arena and throwing them at a goalpost before time runs out. Tag has you collecting a set number of tokens that have been scattered throughout the arena within a set time limit.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ball-breakers"},{"id":19288,"collection":{"id":2135,"created_at":1460332800,"games":[18305,18718,19287,19288],"name":"Clock Tower","slug":"clock-tower","updated_at":1460332800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/clock-tower","checksum":"61f47bb3-ac0c-cdbb-cd30-2e4a0906812d"},"cover":{"id":98211,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":19288,"height":800,"image_id":"co23s3","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co23s3.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"3a0cb066-7166-fd1e-ed06-2ed5dfaffe5e"},"first_release_date":889660800,"genres":[{"id":2,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Point-and-click","slug":"point-and-click","updated_at":1323302400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/point-and-click","checksum":"ef2ff68a-f7bd-d2d0-76cb-c830bd6e3191"},{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":35458,"company":{"id":1744,"name":"Human Entertainment","slug":"human-entertainment"}},{"id":35459,"company":{"id":1566,"name":"Agetec","slug":"agetec"}},{"id":35460,"company":{"id":1744,"name":"Human Entertainment","slug":"human-entertainment"}}],"name":"Clock Tower II: The Struggle Within","platforms":[7],"rating":18.2125670555778,"rating_count":5,"release_dates":[{"id":50913,"category":0,"created_at":1463788800,"date":889660800,"game":19288,"human":"Mar 12, 1998","m":3,"platform":7,"region":5,"updated_at":1463788800,"y":1998,"checksum":"229f525c-5c32-0278-65b3-a910acf522a3"},{"id":50914,"category":0,"created_at":1463788800,"date":941068800,"game":19288,"human":"Oct 28, 1999","m":10,"platform":7,"region":2,"updated_at":1463788800,"y":1999,"checksum":"d01e3de3-2534-d641-3c25-8c9d0184d72b"}],"screenshots":[{"id":23897,"game":19288,"height":684,"image_id":"ho8zjti126giaplyxuqn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ho8zjti126giaplyxuqn.jpg","width":1061,"checksum":"7f7645b3-705d-e7c2-6304-8c4c1ef44c5b"},{"id":23898,"game":19288,"height":684,"image_id":"kf0l1xg6too8uvwk9n8l","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kf0l1xg6too8uvwk9n8l.jpg","width":1210,"checksum":"363ecc2c-00a6-7198-f0a3-71fd256fb59f"},{"id":23899,"game":19288,"height":683,"image_id":"izi1nblv5pf4on18dwiy","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/izi1nblv5pf4on18dwiy.jpg","width":1032,"checksum":"7f33d401-df9a-9161-4c28-e467bee62df6"},{"id":23900,"game":19288,"height":283,"image_id":"hmz3uesfvjljvu5hfc2i","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hmz3uesfvjljvu5hfc2i.jpg","width":400,"checksum":"2e3aa8fc-36c2-c137-3682-e6245391e68a"},{"id":23901,"game":19288,"height":684,"image_id":"iqrr2lwzizrjb3coe3ry","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iqrr2lwzizrjb3coe3ry.jpg","width":1057,"checksum":"64cc2399-4126-66ef-0a14-6b9138c74b5a"}],"slug":"clock-tower-ii-the-struggle-within","summary":"Clock Tower II: The Struggle Within, known as Clock Tower: Ghost Head in Japan, is a PlayStation point-and-click survival horror game and the third installment in the Clock Tower series.

In the North American version, the setting was changed to Salinas, California, and the characters were given Westernized names. However, untranslated Japanese can be seen in the hospital entrance and even in the intro, there are Japanese-styled buildings, including a Shinto shrine.

There are shipwrecks and ruins to discover, dozens of species of fish and sea life to observe, and no reasons to hurry.","total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/aquanauts-holiday"},{"id":132807,"collection":{"id":602,"created_at":1388966400,"games":[3467,3677,3678,3679,3680,3681,4789,5800,5801,5802,6658,6779,6780,6953,6954,6955,21282,21782,22296,23794,43218,43577,43680,43746,44711,44796,47301,50643,50681,50684,50733,62839,65604,66659,67248,68981,69572,72734,72735,73042,73426,73949,77640,79476,79697,79708,93034,128003,132805,132807,132809,135374,135375,135376,135384,135385,135387,135392,135393,135396],"name":"Dance Dance Revolution","slug":"dance-dance-revolution","updated_at":1388966400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/dance-dance-revolution","checksum":"93b067f6-a9a1-8065-251b-c673d32ac519"},"cover":{"id":107377,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":132807,"height":650,"image_id":"co2aup","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2aup.jpg","width":650,"checksum":"837dbad0-91ce-0a3a-b788-80e86d8bbf6f"},"first_release_date":943488000,"franchises":[{"id":1651,"created_at":1575676800,"games":[3677,3678,3679,6779,6780,22296,23794,43680,43746,44711,51020,62839,66659,68981,73426,73949,77640,78971,78977,79244,79697,79708,80106,93034,98811,112148,126031,127142,128003,130015,132807,135089,135374,135375,135376,135384,135385,135387,135392,135393,135394,135395,135396,135469,135470,135471,135477,135509,135510],"name":"BEMANI","slug":"bemani","updated_at":1575676800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/bemani","checksum":"e81972c3-09e1-8187-f527-adfd95b63142"}],"genres":[{"id":7,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Music","slug":"music","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/music","checksum":"22d44a0d-89c7-580f-eef2-e06f178fdd47"},{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":102624,"company":{"id":129,"description":"Konami Holdings Corporation, commonly referred to as Konami, is a Japanese entertainment and gaming conglomerate.

You chose your rhythm tracks, bass lines, guitar riffs, and triangle hits in this complete music-making experience. You can make rock, pop, hip-hop, techno, or jazz songs, and each will be vastly different from the others. There are more than 1,500 riffs and 3,000 instrument sounds to choose from, and you can even write your own parts instead of using the pre-programmed melodies. Just about everything you can think of can be manipulated here, right down to the volume of the floor toms, the amount of reverb applied to each instrument, and the song's tempo. The next step is to create a music video for your masterpiece, and you'll have plenty of 3D clips at your disposal in so doing. Once you have your complete package, you can save everything to a memory card and access any part of it (from an instrument sound or keyboard riff to the entire song) later.

The game supports the analog controller. \n \nThe play can make many modifications to a car's performance. The player can: adjust the tires to fit the road (hard for ovals or soft for road courses), as well as modify gear ratios and aerodynamics. Moving the front of the car down or slanting the wings may enable the player to find a perfect combination of speed and handling. During simulation mode races, the car's tires will wear down and fuel will deplete (both can be replaced by a pit stop). \n \nIn addition to the real drivers and cars (Honda and Ford included), ten official CART tracks have been included – each modeled after its real-life counterpart. Tracks span the United States and are located in Cleveland, Michigan, Long Beach and more. Each features realistic dynamics and road handling in an attempt to create a believable racing experience. In Season Mode, the player will take part in a series of races, for which the player must qualify and race, earning points toward a cup.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/cart-world-series"},{"id":8614,"collection":{"id":2196,"created_at":1466294400,"games":[3878,8614,11391,13561,19678,36508,80507],"name":"Digimon World","slug":"digimon-world","updated_at":1466294400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/digimon-world","checksum":"7a9e81b5-3743-c2d7-e064-0a0a9aa75748"},"cover":{"id":76556,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":8614,"height":800,"image_id":"co1n2k","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1n2k.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"88e9debc-3015-d919-8569-cf129d86fc32"},"first_release_date":917481600,"franchises":[{"id":191,"created_at":1390176000,"games":[3877,3878,4133,6374,6375,6376,8613,8614,9286,11391,13561,15705,19678,20609,25791,27920,36508,64699,67307,78285,80507,85664,105417,112400,112401,120551],"name":"Digimon","slug":"digimon","updated_at":1390176000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/digimon","checksum":"c6619a77-fceb-6e8b-f7bc-0a834859db0c"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":21274,"company":{"id":617,"description":"Bandai Co., Ltd.

It was also released on the Sega Saturn. \n \nThis compilation includes the classic games: \n \n- Konami's Boxing (1984): \nA boxing game with a couple of moves, with the standard jabs complimented by body punches and the ability to dodge, duck or raise your guard. Each punch weakens your opponent's strength, although going long enough without being hit can see this begin to recover. A rain of blows can produce a quick knockout, but in general you must hit him many times, and then with a knockout blow, to see him go down. There is a referee. The game has a two player option. \n \n- Konami's Ping-Pong (1985): \nFrom Konami's coin-op, Ping Pong recreates the fast-paced sport of table tennis. To win each match you must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game goes on until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin. \n \n- Hyper Sports 2 (1985): \nThree tough events await in this joystick-waggling action game. The full sequence of events is - skeet shooting, archery and weightlifting. You must complete each event in order to be allowed onto the next one. \n \n- Mopiranger (1985): \nThe peaceful land of the Mopira have been invaded by the Razons. In this platform game you 'll play Mopiranger and you have to save the young Moplits, who have been kidnapped by the dastardly Razons. The levels are build in a maze-like pattern in which you have to find and rescue the young Moplits from the hostile Razons. Using the obstacles present in the game you can block the Razons, but also lock yourself in... \n \n- Antarctic Adventure (1984): \nAs a penguin, you must travel around Antarctica, making your way between bases before time runs out. This sounds easy, right? Wrong. Hindering your progress will be ice crevices and leopard seals. You can jump over the crevices, but jumping over the leopard seals may be difficult. You can speed up or slow down the penguin to avoid both of these hazards. The bases include Australia, France, New Zealand, USA, Argentina, UK, and Japan. You can collect flags and eat fish for points. Collecting a flashing flag will allow you to wear a propeller that enable you to fly over those hazards. \n \n- Yie Ar Kung-Fu (1984): \nBased on the popular arcade game, Yie Ar Kung-Fu follows Oolong's quest to become a Kung-Fu master. Of course this involves fighting a wide range of opponents in a traditional one-on-one 2D environment. Oolong has a wide range of attacks he can use to lower his opponent's life bar, including traditional punching and kicking attacks as well as jumping ones. Opponents are well armed with unique weapons and attacks, so Oolong's task won't be easy. \n \n- Road Fighter (1985): \nA top view racing game. You have to reach the finish line before time runs out. Don't crash into the wall, cars or trucks. Because if you do you will lose gasoline. You can get additional gasoline by picking up fuel items. Especially avoid the purple cars, they do change lanes! And remember... oil makes road slippery... \n \n- Sky Jaguar (1984): \nVertical shooter. When a weakened and vulnerable Earth is invaded by the vicious Zephyr army, the planet's only hope is a fleet of powerful ships, the Sky Jaguars. It 'll take sharp reflexes and amazing skills to survive the Zephyrians' unrelenting assault... can you last long enough to discover and destroy the enemy's hidden headquarters? \n \n- Gradius (1986): \nThe people of Gradius are in trouble. The ameoboid Bacterions have launched an all out attack against the planet, and it's up to you to fly into battle and save them. Along the way you'll be able to power up your ship with hyper speed, force fields, lasers, missiles, double beam cannons and more to help you battle. Based on the arcade game, Gradius is a side scrolling shooter. Shooting certain enemies will leave a power up pod behind which can be collected to add more power to your ship. Each level features a wide variety of enemies trying to stop you, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay is for one player or two players alternating. \n \n- Gofer no Yabou: Episode 2 (1988): \nAlso known as Nemesis 3 - The Eye Of Destruction. Gradius 3 is a vertical scrolling shoot 'm up. Shooting at certain enemies will leave a power up pod behind which can be collected to add more power to your space ship (for example special weapons or a force field). Every level features a wide variety of enemies trying to stop you, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay is for one player or two players alternating. In Gradius 3 the planet Gradius is involved in 3 space wars: versus Bacterion, Venom and Salamander!","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/konami-antiques-msx-collection-vol-1"},{"id":2543,"collection":{"id":500,"created_at":1373414400,"games":[2543,2545,2546,2548,2550,2558,2559,20033,45464],"name":"Dragon Ball Z: Butōden","slug":"dragon-ball-z-butoden","updated_at":1373414400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/dragon-ball-z-butoden","checksum":"a8efb6d7-f9c6-7bea-6bb5-6a7ae1408780"},"cover":{"id":2496,"game":2543,"height":512,"image_id":"mqhhiqtqghtqqlk81emj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mqhhiqtqghtqqlk81emj.jpg","width":509,"checksum":"fa6f7a25-3bf1-f753-7843-787b3d04aafb"},"first_release_date":806889600,"franchises":[{"id":56,"created_at":1372377600,"games":[2252,2253,2254,2543,2545,2546,2548,2550,2557,2558,2559,2560,2561,2562,2563,2564,2565,2566,2567,2568,2569,2570,2571,2572,2573,2574,2575,2576,2577,2578,2579,2580,2581,2582,2583,3896,6386,6387,7355,19308,19309,19314,19449,19834,19835,19958,20412,24269,36911,38395,38396,38662,40263,45464,45758,48500,48678,48679,48680,48681,48682,48697,50575,66082,66405,72395,72764,74038,78549,86425,90008,92697,95014,105056,111054,114009,128863,132643],"name":"Dragon Ball","slug":"dragon-ball","updated_at":1372377600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/dragon-ball","checksum":"b08021bc-df9a-cf85-bbc6-f2667c68761f"}],"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":5974,"company":{"id":82,"logo":{"id":1568,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":160,"image_id":"b0bv0naux50nfsas5yht","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b0bv0naux50nfsas5yht.jpg","width":146,"checksum":"6f6f16c0-1219-05c4-da15-8782af311b60"},"name":"Atari","slug":"atari"}},{"id":5975,"company":{"id":213,"description":"Infogrames Entertainment, SA  was an international French holding company headquartered in Lyon, France.

You start at a small school, but as you accumulate victories you can earn promotions into the bigger and more lucrative programs, where you can ultimately make a run for the National Championship. You can choose from 114 NCAA Division I-A teams, as well as 50 classic teams from the past. The game features a TV-style presentation, with Keith Jackson handling the play-by-play. You also get a Play Editor, where you can customize and create your own plays, and you can also draft players into NFL GAMEDAY 2000.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ncaa-gamebreaker-2000"},{"id":19418,"collection":{"id":2170,"created_at":1464998400,"games":[19418],"name":"Strike","slug":"strike","updated_at":1464998400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/strike","checksum":"2c795f99-d247-126e-2ae3-25b88bc9b5a8"},"cover":{"id":85969,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":19418,"height":800,"image_id":"co1uc1","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1uc1.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"077b9c65-353f-9e59-f2a8-5f700234f14c"},"first_release_date":846720000,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":35840,"company":{"id":1,"description":"Electronic Arts Inc. is a leading global interactive entertainment software company.

A new 3D engine allows for visible damage and effects such as reflections and mud sticking to your car or truck. Speaking of vehicles, you select from a pool of ten with different ratings in power, top speed and weight. \n \nYou can also customize shocks, steering response, brakes, gearing ratios, transmission, tires (choose from all purpose, off-road, snow or slick) and even paint--both body and detail colors can be set to your liking. Yet the most notable addition is the track editor, which allows you to build your own course from scratch or modify an existing one to add more jumps, 90 degree turns, mud pits, and several other features. In total, there are 16 different track pieces you can position on an 8 x 8 grid using one of three themes: desert, snow or forest.

The various gangs are taking advantage of the G-Police by exploiting their weakened and exhausted task force. With crime back on the rise, the city will have to pull through and pray for a miracle --- fortunately, they're prayers have been answered. \n \nAfter an attempt to silence the terrorist organizations, your squad receives word of Marines being sent in to help with the current situation. Unfortunately, they're a few days away from the city and the G-Police can't keep things under control; the rivalry between good and evil heats up before their arrival. \n \nWhen the Marines and their heavy firepower enter the city -- things are already too late. Those small gangs have turned into full-blown crime syndicates making the force of good's job much harder. Fortunately, your squad of officers has the upper hand -- the G-Police uses a variety of five attack choppers including the Venom and Havoc. Additionally, the Marines have supplied their Corsair cruise ship, Raptor, and Rhino --- a giant mechanized robot used for mass destruction and a heavily armed patrol vehicle, respectively.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/g-police-weapons-of-justice"},{"id":44994,"collection":{"id":529,"created_at":1374537600,"games":[2702,3417,3440,3441,5732,6307,6308,8498,22830,22833,26819,27454,43554,43947,43948,43949,44994,47694,47721,49314,49954,50582,73898,75693],"name":"Army Men","slug":"army-men","updated_at":1374537600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/army-men","checksum":"0b318335-32ec-703e-7bd0-5ac550135d4d"},"cover":{"id":62746,"game":44994,"height":2819,"image_id":"y9q5ixkmwmlpc2awq6ql","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y9q5ixkmwmlpc2awq6ql.jpg","width":2400,"checksum":"904a68b1-053a-7a28-45a9-790cc4cf223f"},"first_release_date":959558400,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":83360,"company":{"id":99,"logo":{"id":247,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":60,"image_id":"lrhmkn7bnyncmj8ms6wn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lrhmkn7bnyncmj8ms6wn.jpg","width":147,"checksum":"b793b19c-2987-81f0-85b2-5d791f171393"},"name":"The 3DO Company","slug":"the-3do-company"}}],"name":"Army Men: World War","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99169,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":959558400,"game":44994,"human":"May 29, 2000","m":5,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":2000,"checksum":"2af800f1-8a5e-b597-6bfc-efa9c1e3294b"}],"slug":"army-men-world-war","summary":"16 missions await you and your green army as you wage war against the tan army through true world war environments including beaches, jungles, countrysides and war-torn cities.

Fans of the predecessor will appreciate this sequel.","total_rating":40,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/speedball-2100"},{"id":17453,"cover":{"id":14120,"game":17453,"height":297,"image_id":"hed851cr6ugjiexgv14w","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hed851cr6ugjiexgv14w.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"04a01d3d-ccd0-55e3-1a7c-51c20b46e1c5"},"first_release_date":883526400,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":32218,"company":{"id":359,"name":"Hammerhead","slug":"hammerhead"}},{"id":32219,"company":{"id":764,"logo":{"id":244,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":188,"image_id":"jzat4lzichs6b5oa1ptu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jzat4lzichs6b5oa1ptu.jpg","width":250,"checksum":"0075b068-3738-4f31-d257-8bc4a11b0aa0"},"name":"Psygnosis","slug":"psygnosis"}}],"name":"Shadow Master","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":46241,"category":0,"created_at":1454976000,"date":883526400,"game":17453,"human":"Dec 31, 1997","m":12,"platform":7,"region":2,"updated_at":1454976000,"y":1997,"checksum":"76aa71a2-140c-8700-d3fd-f3cce1e3fc57"}],"screenshots":[{"id":20327,"game":17453,"height":234,"image_id":"iucd5sy3amqgklk7z57f","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iucd5sy3amqgklk7z57f.jpg","width":312,"checksum":"268f4cc7-9161-dc15-e124-9f7ae95ef1d0"}],"slug":"shadow-master--1","summary":"Sci-Fi First Person Shooter where the player controls a heavily armed vehicle.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shadow-master--1"},{"id":45067,"collection":{"id":120,"created_at":1317686400,"games":[630,631,632,3919,12909,13482,15875,15876,15877,15878,15879,15880,15881,15882,15883,15884,20777,23714,44719,45067,80177],"name":"Chessmaster","slug":"chessmaster","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/chessmaster","checksum":"162ca897-966e-7065-5fc4-92f7877cf767"},"cover":{"id":28423,"game":45067,"height":1402,"image_id":"bd8hsnumxk1hc5aupkfa","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bd8hsnumxk1hc5aupkfa.jpg","width":1385,"checksum":"98dc173c-17a1-6d56-2726-cc3e2dec4858"},"first_release_date":823132800,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"The Chessmaster 3-D","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99378,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":823132800,"game":45067,"human":"Feb 01, 1996","m":2,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1996,"checksum":"baa365b3-b393-cf71-a1d4-de779bab4247"}],"slug":"the-chessmaster-3-d","summary":"Based on the popular computer chess program, The Chessmaster 3-D for the PlayStation allows players to challenge a friend or one of 12 virtual chess opponents. Each computer-controlled opponent is rated according to ability. There are also six unique chess sets (each with animated pieces) from which to choose, including Alphabet, Celestial, Deco, Mechanical, Modern, and Staunton. \n \nIf you need assistance in deciding which pieces to move in order to secure a checkmate, the ChessMaster is available to lend a helping hand. You can perfect your chess playing skills using various teaching options; you can even view the computer's thought process as it \"thinks\" through each move. \n \nWhile this is obviously a 3D title, you can switch the camera angle for a more traditional two-dimensional perspective. The camera is adjustable in that you're able to zoom it in and out until you find a view that is to your liking. You can even switch playing sides (from black to white pieces or vise versa) or simply have a quick look at the other side of the board.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-chessmaster-3-d"},{"id":13659,"collection":{"id":2239,"created_at":1468022400,"games":[13659,20144,20145,20146,20147,20148,67823],"name":"Gallop Racer","slug":"gallop-racer","updated_at":1468022400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/gallop-racer","checksum":"0611068f-8136-e1f7-c84e-d88fa3ba5358"},"cover":{"id":54623,"game":13659,"height":715,"image_id":"trtcszshdvehp8ilmtws","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/trtcszshdvehp8ilmtws.jpg","width":715,"checksum":"c7a55e83-60aa-8f3b-5628-f6f5b0abac09"},"first_release_date":924307200,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Gallop Racer","platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"id":99326,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":924307200,"game":13659,"human":"Apr 17, 1999","m":4,"platform":7,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1999,"checksum":"1ce841bc-8b25-9a52-e115-a0bd4ef84a25"}],"screenshots":[{"id":26735,"game":13659,"height":360,"image_id":"dixehmam1oskslqk7ag5","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dixehmam1oskslqk7ag5.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"c44ada44-0f4a-a33c-3dee-7c2adf9b3d42"}],"slug":"gallop-racer","summary":"Gallop Racer is an open-ended game.

Play modes include Exhibition, Tournament, Great Games, Season, Practice, and Dynasty. You get 112 Division I-A teams and their stadiums, so you'll likely find your favorite major college team on the roster. One of the coolest features is the Dynasty mode, in which you try to build a winning program from scratch. While it may be tough to recruit blue-chip prospects in the beginning, as you start winning big games and making a name for your team, getting good players gets easier. But if you can't recruit them, create them with the Create-A-Player mode. This year's version also has improved AI, so you can expect some serious competition from some of the better schools. If you've always wanted to be the Big Man On Campus, now's your chance with NCAA FOOTBALL '99.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ncaa-football-99"}]}
