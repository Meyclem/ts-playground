The console was Atari's attempt to compete with the NES and Sega Master System. Following a massive research project focused on determining exactly what consumers were demanding from a video game platform, Atari knew what it needed for its next generation system. They selected the General Computer Corporation to design new a graphics chip. \"Marie\" was what they named it. It provided a greater spectrum of colors and an endless number of sprites.\n\nThere was also one extra feature Atari added to the Marie chip. In an effort to combat third-party game manufacturers from taking a huge chunk out of their potential software profits, Atari installed an encryption algorithm (like a coded lock) into the Marie Chip. The 7800 would only allow cartridges containing a 960-bit encoded \"key\" to activate its state-of-the-art graphics and sound capabilities. If a cartridge did not include the proper coded authentication, the system remained in its default mode and could only run games made for the 2600.\n\nWith the 7800, Atari attempted to correct all of the shortcomings inherent to the 5200 platform. As stated above, the 7800 was compatible with 2600 cartridges. They had even designed an adapter (later discarded upon release) which would let the 7800 play 5200 cartridges, giving Atari across-the-board compatibility with all previous software. To make the system even more attractive to consumers considering purchasing a home computer, Atari promised an optional keyboard add-on.\n\nWhile size of the 7800 console is much smaller than the immense 5200, the major improvement was made in the joystick design. The 7800 controller was made more in the tradition of the 2600. It is sleek, simple and, most importantly, durable.\n\nIn 1983, the Marie project was a courageous attempt to bring Atari back as the preeminent name in video games. Atari poured their best available personnel into the project. The system was ready and waiting to ignite the stagnant video game market.\n\nUnfortunately timing was working against the proponents of the 7800. In 1984, Warner Communications sold Atari to Jack Tramiel. He wanted to focus on the company's computer line, and the Atari 7800 was shelved.\n\nThe video game market awoke with a roar in 1985. Nintendo had released the NES game system to American consumers. Videogame sales skyrocketed and soon Sega premiered its Sega Master System. Seeing there was money to be made, Atari scrambled to get onto the playing field and released the Atari 7800 in 1986 with only three games: Ms. Pac-Man, Joust and Asteroids.\n\nWith a paltry $300,000 advertising budget Atari gave the system a half-hearted release. Sales for the platform were good, but Atari was also trying to market a computer/console hybrid called the Atari XE and a remodeled version of the Atari 2600. All three platforms remained far behind Nintendo and Sega's offerings. By the time the Atari 7800 started to build up a substantial library of games, it was too late, and the system disappeared from store shelves.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/platforms/atari7800/version/initial-version-b404799e-fb33-4e0b-9721-85224a46dd97","checksum":"fb317997-881b-1022-f036-09cd9037c3c0"}],"checksum":"5ff4efb6-c1d3-1587-5424-b2b5dd05a5d9","games":[{"id":12333,"cover":{"id":26990,"game":12333,"height":2100,"image_id":"unudatkm3ovwqtqofndv","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/unudatkm3ovwqtqofndv.jpg","width":1527,"checksum":"b598a3da-7831-3ce1-d7ee-b115b3c0de34"},"first_release_date":662601600,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":26238,"company":{"id":82,"logo":{"id":1568,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":160,"image_id":"b0bv0naux50nfsas5yht","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b0bv0naux50nfsas5yht.jpg","width":146,"checksum":"6f6f16c0-1219-05c4-da15-8782af311b60"},"name":"Atari","slug":"atari"}},{"id":26239,"company":{"id":1402,"description":"A Californian  video game developer.

You're going to the playoffs.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/touchdown-football"},{"id":12336,"cover":{"id":52817,"game":12336,"height":830,"image_id":"wtnsrwxgeapmuvoaxjba","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wtnsrwxgeapmuvoaxjba.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"90794434-b908-945f-866e-99f1b58af059"},"first_release_date":631065600,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":26247,"company":{"id":82,"logo":{"id":1568,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":160,"image_id":"b0bv0naux50nfsas5yht","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b0bv0naux50nfsas5yht.jpg","width":146,"checksum":"6f6f16c0-1219-05c4-da15-8782af311b60"},"name":"Atari","slug":"atari"}}],"name":"Planet Smashers","platforms":[60],"release_dates":[{"id":35248,"category":2,"created_at":1441411200,"date":631065600,"game":12336,"human":"1989","m":12,"platform":60,"region":8,"updated_at":1441411200,"y":1989,"checksum":"1598ec71-0dfa-4039-c777-ed5afd23d9b6"}],"slug":"planet-smashers","summary":"Planet Smashers finally delivered an original 2D Shooter to the Pro System late in its life. Your spaceship, which oddly looks like an airplane, has the grave task of defending Earth from an alien armada. Planet Smashers has some nice features like level warp codes, laser upgrades, cloaking devices, and interesting bosses. You even have the burden of defending Earth's shield from asteroids and alien ships. The back of the box boasts, \"awesome sound effects\", but the main laser noise is mind-numbingly irritating. After you defeat the game, you are treated to a text ending commanding you to play Alien Brigade, which makes little sense since you just defeated the alien mothership.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/planet-smashers"},{"id":12342,"cover":{"id":52866,"game":12342,"height":831,"image_id":"mqseprjkzvobwmrjmioz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mqseprjkzvobwmrjmioz.jpg","width":601,"checksum":"9dc4b5c9-f43e-541d-658f-e3a7aa2a3bfa"},"first_release_date":599529600,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":26260,"company":{"id":6435,"name":"Froggo Games","slug":"froggo-games"}}],"name":"Tank Command","platforms":[60],"release_dates":[{"id":35270,"category":2,"created_at":1441411200,"date":599529600,"game":12342,"human":"1988","m":12,"platform":60,"region":2,"updated_at":1441411200,"y":1988,"checksum":"2cddd982-502d-ef5a-2c53-bbf7e798315b"}],"slug":"tank-command","summary":"Tank Command is a vertically scrolling action game. You control a tank on a mission to capture the enemy flag as well as earn as many points as possible. To do this, you will need to blast your way through their defenses on three levels of increasing difficulty. Blocking your progress are enemy tanks, pillboxes, missiles, jeeps, infantry, huts, and more, all of which earn you points when destroyed. Your tank is equipped with a limited amount of fuel and ammo, however it can be replenished occasionally by collecting the bonus icons when they appear on the screen. If you can make it past all of the obstacles and capture the flag, then you win the game! \n \nThe 7800 is pretty much void of super-rare games like the 2600'?s Tooth Protectors and Chase the Chuckwagon, but don't worry, tracking down Tank Command in a box will cost you a pretty penny. As far as gameplay goes, Tank Command is not going to blow anyone away. Here you have a vertical scroller like Commando or Ikari Warriors minus the charm, quality level design, and reasonable difficulty. There are only three levels in the game, but just like its Froggo cousin Water Ski, the difficulty ramps so severely after the mindless first level that continuing takes strong will. The pink terrain is a bit odd, as well. Tank Command was only released in NTSC format.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tank-command"},{"id":117410,"cover":{"id":73451,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":117410,"height":1096,"image_id":"co1kob","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1kob.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"d30b8ce1-d585-400f-de85-3937c54abbb4"},"first_release_date":599529600,"genres":[{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":77548,"company":{"id":6435,"name":"Froggo Games","slug":"froggo-games"}}],"name":"Water Ski","platforms":[60],"release_dates":[{"id":168177,"category":2,"created_at":1555200000,"date":599529600,"game":117410,"human":"1988","m":12,"platform":60,"region":8,"updated_at":1555286400,"y":1988,"checksum":"a3bb8266-f3c0-8537-3d70-9ee8ba5d3ea5"}],"slug":"water-ski--2","summary":"In Water Ski you are water skiing on the Pharonna River.

The river is quite dangerous, and features many twists and turns along with rocks, logs and other obstacles. For bonus points there are numerous ramps located throughout the river which your skier can jump over (and if you can manage to ski over every ramp on the level, you'll earn even more points!).

And now you are going crazy waiting to test your sleek, hot, fast customized bike. It absorbs your every waking moment, you dream about it every night. It has become an obsession. And you know just the place to try it out. \n \nThe annual MotorPsycho Competition (for deranged, psychopathic, and other unusual biker types) is this weekend! Its obstacle-laden course is legendary among motorcycle maniacs. Of course, nobody in their right mind would attempt this course. The die-hard spectators remind you that fan is short for fanatic. They've staked out their favorite spots to view the races, and they are waiting for the roar of revving engines, the squeal of tires, the crunch of metal... \n \nIt's you against the clock and your bike is built for speed. All you need to do is point it in the right direction and go for it! \n \nFour different tracks will separate the veterans from the rookies. (Or the schizophrenics from the psychotics.) Weekend amateurs will eat your dust, but you've got some pretty insane competition from your fellow, uh, pros. Some of these guys look hungry for the sweet taste of victory, but some of them look hungry for the taste of raw meat! \n \nSo rev 'er up and let 'er rip! The winner's circle (or the guy with the clean white coat) awaits.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/motor-psycho"}]}
