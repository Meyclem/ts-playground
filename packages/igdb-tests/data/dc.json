The gameplay's emphasis was on enticing fish to bite onto the lure and then successfully fighting the fish and reeling it to the boat. \n \nAs the player catches fish, they earn item cards. Items earned with these cards include fish and artifacts for an aquarium, fishing equipment, additional boats, and various goofy accessories such as different colored shorts. The game also featured two modes of online play: tournament fishing and \"fish mail\". In tournament fishing, players competed to catch the biggest fish within a species. Fish mail consisted of writing short messages. Players could receive random messages by catching fish. \n \nSega Marine Fishing can be played using the Dreamcast fishing rod controller. You could customize your character with hats, shirts, etc.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sega-marine-fishing"},{"id":5555,"collection":{"id":816,"created_at":1394236800,"games":[4351,5553,5554,5555,5556,5557,5558],"name":"Eldorado Gate","slug":"eldorado-gate","updated_at":1394236800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/eldorado-gate","checksum":"8f44ad5b-2ccd-d907-1e39-4296a7c413e9"},"cover":{"id":5649,"game":5555,"height":642,"image_id":"j5t0omhvs0mzond5fvaz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j5t0omhvs0mzond5fvaz.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"09be9662-cfd6-8ace-fe0b-024f71cd123a"},"first_release_date":981072000,"involved_companies":[{"id":98125,"company":{"id":37,"description":"Capcom Co., Ltd. is a Japanese video game developer and publisher known for creating numerous multi-million selling game franchises, including Street Fighter, Mega Man, Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Ace Attorney, Monster Hunter, Dead Rising, Breath of Fire, as well as games based on the Disney animated properties.","logo":{"id":59,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":1024,"image_id":"hcbqwbhbmrabsfk600zs","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hcbqwbhbmrabsfk600zs.jpg","width":5592,"checksum":"349cabef-d8b4-460b-7402-8ec3a60c4e6d"},"name":"Capcom","slug":"capcom"}}],"name":"Eldorado Gate Volume 3","platforms":[23],"release_dates":[{"id":177677,"category":0,"created_at":1571097600,"date":981072000,"game":5555,"human":"Feb 02, 2001","m":2,"platform":23,"region":5,"updated_at":1571097600,"y":2001,"checksum":"cc3d528e-7e86-bbfc-43f8-56e4a09770ce"}],"slug":"eldorado-gate-volume-3","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/eldorado-gate-volume-3"},{"id":10908,"collection":{"id":804,"created_at":1393718400,"games":[4144,5491,5492,5493,5494,10908,19410,19412,19414,19424,19428,23146,31719,46029],"name":"Armored Core","slug":"armored-core","updated_at":1393718400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/armored-core","checksum":"d92fc85c-8740-fd5f-e674-e2cd78b01a57"},"cover":{"id":10364,"game":10908,"height":640,"image_id":"ti1upyw1gkpr3jtot8x9","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ti1upyw1gkpr3jtot8x9.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"8fab88f4-71e7-e652-281a-fe82a84d3c4a"},"first_release_date":931996800,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"},{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":24007,"company":{"id":1012,"logo":{"id":1136,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":155,"image_id":"irwmnrvf0hny5wr0ap0d","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/irwmnrvf0hny5wr0ap0d.jpg","width":1772,"checksum":"c43bf16d-3e14-8893-487a-3864eaa94555"},"name":"FromSoftware","slug":"fromsoftware"}}],"name":"Frame Gride","platforms":[23],"release_dates":[{"id":30166,"category":0,"created_at":1433116800,"date":931996800,"game":10908,"human":"Jul 15, 1999","m":7,"platform":23,"region":5,"updated_at":1433116800,"y":1999,"checksum":"3ec6cc8e-3587-2477-d558-92fd27e983be"}],"slug":"frame-gride","summary":"From Software's attempt to create a fantasy-themed take on Armored Core.

These discs included a trimmed down version of the game based on the Japanese release and had saving and network connectivity disabled along with other minor differences; they were known to be buggy. \n \nLater, a variant of the release was distributed to Hollywood Video as part of a pre-release promotion in which the game could be rented along with a console before it’s official launch. This variant of the game allowed saving and included a case and manual. The disc, game manual cover, and spine of the case all state “Limited Edition” and the artwork differs slightly from the standard edition release. Due to it’s exclusive distribution through a rental chain many of the original game cases were lost or destroyed and replaced in whole or in part with cases or manuals from the standard edition release, also many discs were tagged with a “Hollywood Video” security sticker.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-adventure-limited-edition"},{"id":45791,"cover":{"id":80564,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":45791,"height":1408,"image_id":"co1q5w","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1q5w.jpg","width":1392,"checksum":"3659fb60-9cfd-3c9f-eab7-cacf999db05e"},"first_release_date":939427200,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"name":"Buggy Heat","platforms":[23],"release_dates":[{"id":98269,"category":0,"created_at":1500422400,"date":939427200,"game":45791,"human":"Oct 09, 1999","m":10,"platform":23,"region":8,"updated_at":1500422400,"y":1999,"checksum":"748809a4-dd4a-8f64-352e-1761e67646e9"}],"screenshots":[{"id":112433,"game":45791,"height":540,"image_id":"kp6j7grorcd0ucjlp32l","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kp6j7grorcd0ucjlp32l.jpg","width":960,"checksum":"e0d8bbe7-d11f-5983-48cb-f8aa6c64a595"}],"slug":"buggy-heat","summary":"Ladies and Gentlemen, get ready for the biggest and wildest race of your life...

The matches take place inside a giant floating cube. You are able to fly, using your psychic abilities, around a 3D arena with six walls. Each of the ten available characters, Might, Regina, Wendy, Emilio, Setsuna, Patty, Gudeath, Genshin, Carlo, and Gates, are controlled with three buttons: guard, weak attack and strong attack. The effect varies with the distance. Next to the regular life meter, there is also a power meter. By using special moves, the meter is drained and your moves are limited. It is possible to recharge, and the capacity of the power meter expands when you lose a lot of health. \n \nAdditionally, each fighter has its own unique moves, energy attacks and a weapon, which they use, mid-flight, to pummel their opponent. There are three main game modes: training, versus and a story mode using static anime-inspired images and in-engine cut scenes to tell the story. The story centers around two groups of psychics with differing ideals about co-existence with humans.

It was originally released on NAOMI hardware in arcades. As in the original, players select a team of fighters from various Capcom and SNK games then fight other teams, winning each battle by defeating all the opponents from the other team. \n \nAspects of the first game were tweaked, including the Ratio system. In contrast to the fixed system of the original, players can now freely select characters and assign each of them a number from one to four (or \"Ratio\") determining their relative strength, adding up to a maximum team ratio of four. Teams can now consist of a maximum of three characters, as opposed to four in the first game. Additional characters were added, including more characters from Capcom and SNK titles outside of the Street Fighter and King of Fighters series. The Groove system from Millennium Fight 2000 has been augmented to include four new systems of play based on various Capcom and SNK fighting games. In addition, the number of buttons has been increased from the Neo Geo standard of four to the six button system first seen in Capcom's Street Fighter. \n \nThe game was initially ported to the Sega Dreamcast, followed by a version for the PlayStation 2. The GameCube and Xbox received an updated version titled Capcom vs. SNK 2 EO, with the \"EO\" referring to \"Easy Operation\", a game option intended for novices to the game.

Elemental Gimmick Gear uses hand-drawn art in an overhead view during exploration, then switches to 3D graphics during boss battles. \n \nIn the world of Tokion, a dome-shaped ancient ruin was discovered inside a thick jungle. During excavation, an egg-shaped mecha was found inside the ruins containing a sleeping man. No matter how hard scientists tried, he would not wake up. He was taken to a laboratory along with the machine to be further studied. \n \nUpon analyzing the machine, they learned that it was over 5000 years old. They also could not find any form of power source. In time, the machine became known as \"Elemental Gimmick Gear\", or EGG for short. After extensive scientific analysis over a number of years, copies of the EGG were produced and used as vehicles. \n \n100 years later, the ruin suddenly became active, extending a multitude of tentacles into the ground. They spread all across the land, destroying anything in their way. With the tentacles came a thick layer of fog that surrounded the ruins, and people gave them the name Fogna. \n \nAt the same time, the Sleeper who was discovered a century prior finally awoke. He had not aged a day since his discovery and had no memory of his past or his own name. Selen, who was with him as he woke, set him free without notifying the other scientists in the lab. She sent him to Fogna to begin searching for clues of what happened 5100 years ago, and to stop the tentacles' breeding.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/elemental-gimmick-gear"},{"id":45839,"cover":{"id":51221,"game":45839,"height":376,"image_id":"c8pc5ywlcjxklhcq6mkf","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c8pc5ywlcjxklhcq6mkf.jpg","width":325,"checksum":"490876da-537f-1ab9-d387-83bfd2005160"},"first_release_date":978134400,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Sno-Cross Championship Racing","platforms":[23],"release_dates":[{"id":98223,"category":0,"created_at":1500422400,"date":978134400,"game":45839,"human":"Dec 30, 2000","m":12,"platform":23,"region":8,"updated_at":1500422400,"y":2000,"checksum":"b9520ffa-8ccb-fa1e-285b-55be24b7d0d1"}],"slug":"sno-cross-championship-racing","summary":"Race snowmobiles during different weather and times of the day.

The most obvious point is that although most planes come from real World War 2 aircraft, the theatre of operations is a bit unique; The four major sides to the conflict (American, British, German, Japanese) are all fighting one another over a group of islands somewhere in the Pacific. Thus each of these nations is represented in close proximity and in direct conflict to one another. \n \nThe gameplay takes place over a series of single-player flight missions in which your American pilot will fight against the Axis forces and ally with the British. The majority of the missions take place in the air against other aerial targets.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/iron-aces"},{"id":3709,"collection":{"id":621,"created_at":1389484800,"games":[3708,3709,19711,45819],"name":"AeroWings","slug":"aerowings","updated_at":1389484800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/aerowings","checksum":"06bc8669-7bf4-b2d2-b798-ae1bbcf8ab9f"},"cover":{"id":3847,"game":3709,"height":252,"image_id":"hk8enflyqrr3hqxbtzdw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hk8enflyqrr3hqxbtzdw.jpg","width":250,"checksum":"f7d63cac-f68f-097c-9960-5ab1f75ae27b"},"first_release_date":920505600,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":9581,"company":{"id":667,"logo":{"id":111,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":93,"image_id":"joyobemqo7d43ighpmqb","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/joyobemqo7d43ighpmqb.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"7c07dc14-1e35-2346-e4f4-b456f0f967c8"},"name":"Crave Entertainment","slug":"crave-entertainment"}},{"id":9582,"company":{"id":1885,"name":"CRI Middleware","slug":"cri-middleware"}}],"name":"AeroWings","platforms":[23],"release_dates":[{"id":8366,"category":0,"created_at":1389398400,"date":920505600,"game":3709,"human":"Mar 04, 1999","m":3,"platform":23,"region":8,"updated_at":1389398400,"y":1999,"checksum":"9c469957-2d8c-186c-4748-fae4a7cc233f"}],"slug":"aerowings","summary":"AeroWings is a simulation that allows the player to fly as a member of a jet aerobatics team.

Flash your headlights when tailing a rival to incite a race, and after a short cinematic, you're both off. To win a race, you need to take down your opponent's power meter, while keeping yours intact. It decreases when hitting objects, and, more importantly, in last place.\n\nThe game is less focused on the realism of a racer, but still takes into account a good amount of customization, from upgrades to tuning. Since you'll be driving the car almost constantly, its best to have your own personal vehicle. The roads you drive on start out limited, but expand as you dive deeper and deeper into the game. Don't expect to go without memorizing the tracks; in order to beat the best, you need to make Tokyo your home.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tokyo-xtreme-racer-2"},{"id":5553,"collection":{"id":816,"created_at":1394236800,"games":[4351,5553,5554,5555,5556,5557,5558],"name":"Eldorado Gate","slug":"eldorado-gate","updated_at":1394236800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/eldorado-gate","checksum":"8f44ad5b-2ccd-d907-1e39-4296a7c413e9"},"cover":{"id":5650,"game":5553,"height":640,"image_id":"ucl4ntckjr1ow4eqrzrs","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ucl4ntckjr1ow4eqrzrs.jpg","width":646,"checksum":"c4e148ee-2b7f-1475-9a52-51241b038ebe"},"first_release_date":971136000,"involved_companies":[{"id":98123,"company":{"id":37,"description":"Capcom Co., Ltd. is a Japanese video game developer and publisher known for creating numerous multi-million selling game franchises, including Street Fighter, Mega Man, Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Ace Attorney, Monster Hunter, Dead Rising, Breath of Fire, as well as games based on the Disney animated properties.","logo":{"id":59,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":1024,"image_id":"hcbqwbhbmrabsfk600zs","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hcbqwbhbmrabsfk600zs.jpg","width":5592,"checksum":"349cabef-d8b4-460b-7402-8ec3a60c4e6d"},"name":"Capcom","slug":"capcom"}}],"name":"Eldorado Gate Volume 1","platforms":[23],"release_dates":[{"id":177675,"category":0,"created_at":1571097600,"date":971136000,"game":5553,"human":"Oct 10, 2000","m":10,"platform":23,"region":5,"updated_at":1571097600,"y":2000,"checksum":"bbc4d139-bbb7-7666-c8c9-b6f55fd6a72f"}],"slug":"eldorado-gate-volume-1","summary":"Part of Capcom's experiment of serializing an RPG over a year with one part every other month.

The gameplay is similar to Cabal, you move left and right dodging enemies while charging up you weapons to blast them away. \n \nThere are three different marines you can choose from, each with their own set of weapons. As usual there is the balanced character (Johnny Rock), a weaker but faster one (Pamela Hewitt) and a slower but stronger one (Nicholas Woods). \n \nYou can choose to play in one player mode, time attack or two player mode. The missions are broken up into small areas where you have to kill all enemies before moving on to the next area. Each mission ends with a boss character such as a giant insect or a Godzilla-like monster. \n \nUse the X, Y or B buttons to choose a weapon, press A to charge and shoot and aim with analog stick. There are different types of weapons that can be used on the different types of enemies. For example the single missiles for far away targets and torpedoes for underwater enemies. \n \nYou can fire your weapon continuously, but this doesn't do as much damage compared to a fully charged shot. Charging each shot means you have to aim a little more carefully, but you'll especially need this in the later levels. You can dodge enemies with the L and R buttons.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/charge-n-blast"},{"id":45820,"cover":{"id":28053,"game":45820,"height":1218,"image_id":"ygohqro3kolymigv2idm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ygohqro3kolymigv2idm.jpg","width":1084,"checksum":"f6a42e29-4d8d-fe5d-4371-54d44cb41b3b"},"first_release_date":968544000,"genres":[{"id":7,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Music","slug":"music","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/music","checksum":"22d44a0d-89c7-580f-eef2-e06f178fdd47"}],"name":"Snk's Cool Cool Toon","platforms":[23],"release_dates":[{"id":98247,"category":0,"created_at":1500422400,"date":968544000,"game":45820,"human":"Sep 10, 2000","m":9,"platform":23,"region":8,"updated_at":1500422400,"y":2000,"checksum":"b9a6a2fe-64c9-438b-b0be-9ccb6f204da2"}],"slug":"snks-cool-cool-toon","summary":"Cool Cool Toon (クルクルトゥーン?) is a rhythm-based music video game exclusive to the Dreamcast.

Keep them out of sight of guards, spring traps on them, or engage them in hand-to-hand or ranged combat.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/industrial-spy-operation-espionage"},{"id":9189,"cover":{"id":9481,"game":9189,"height":266,"image_id":"gzu36czds39ohue8faco","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gzu36czds39ohue8faco.jpg","width":270,"checksum":"6b3315e6-9304-af03-e1cb-335f5dece0c5"},"first_release_date":961632000,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":22407,"company":{"id":428,"logo":{"id":274,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":300,"image_id":"s7c45vmicmzbmcuhs1up","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s7c45vmicmzbmcuhs1up.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"22bbad13-0e32-f26e-6384-2df2594d0316"},"name":"Treyarch","slug":"treyarch"}},{"id":22408,"company":{"id":667,"logo":{"id":111,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":93,"image_id":"joyobemqo7d43ighpmqb","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/joyobemqo7d43ighpmqb.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"7c07dc14-1e35-2346-e4f4-b456f0f967c8"},"name":"Crave Entertainment","slug":"crave-entertainment"}},{"id":95649,"company":{"id":24213,"name":"Interplay","slug":"interplay"}}],"name":"Draconus: Cult of the Wyrm","platforms":[23],"release_dates":[{"id":27404,"category":0,"created_at":1425254400,"date":961632000,"game":9189,"human":"Jun 22, 2000","m":6,"platform":23,"region":2,"updated_at":1425254400,"y":2000,"checksum":"5739c477-5d99-54b1-faca-03bd7c139cdc"},{"id":27405,"category":0,"created_at":1425254400,"date":962323200,"game":9189,"human":"Jun 30, 2000","m":6,"platform":23,"region":1,"updated_at":1425254400,"y":2000,"checksum":"81c8d5ab-ddb6-7b16-b5b3-0a468a5699fb"}],"screenshots":[{"id":333223,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":9189,"height":591,"image_id":"sc7547","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7547.jpg","width":790,"checksum":"41e2b508-b31e-8d4f-e399-a8786f2f8668"},{"id":333224,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":9189,"height":591,"image_id":"sc7548","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7548.jpg","width":790,"checksum":"ed5a02ca-5c2e-fb7e-e27e-172ea1c05a08"},{"id":333225,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":9189,"height":592,"image_id":"sc7549","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7549.jpg","width":789,"checksum":"a38d3221-c972-10a9-c327-358b3abfeee8"}],"slug":"draconus-cult-of-the-wyrm","summary":"Draconus: Cult of the Wyrm is a sword and sorcery action game.
