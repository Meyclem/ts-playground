Controlling the Special Farces team of four, players negotiate fiendish levels and take on a huge range of warped enemies to hunt down the Kindred, a cult dedicated to resurrecting the mighty Dragon Kin, a race of humanoid dragon hybrids, determined to replace the Overlord's despotism with their own. Extending the Overlord series' trademark humour, gameplay focuses on the mischievous physical comedy of the minion's antics and is delivered in a stylised cartoon visual style.","total_rating":60,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/overlord-minions"},{"id":122534,"collection":{"id":2986,"created_at":1506556800,"games":[360,2361,2473,2926,3006,3166,3613,3782,3883,3884,3885,3886,3887,4066,4234,4406,4666,4806,5218,5254,5261,6200,6434,6589,6756,8067,8127,8130,8144,8149,8150,8151,8152,8163,8446,8447,8452,9056,10610,10662,10791,12052,12122,12826,12910,13379,17172,17753,17765,17829,18102,18142,19004,19212,19218,19761,19900,20390,20542,20627,21086,22325,22468,23586,24979,25911,27791,30977,36227,36312,40638,40695,43375,43499,43724,43737,43895,44013,44025,44839,44877,45043,45228,45564,45575,46210,46233,46431,46434,46446,46673,47392,47728,47753,47789,47790,47859,47868,48992,49153,49186,49190,49202,49275,49278,49282,49304,49339,49376,49404,49405,49406,49407,49409,49410,49478,49494,49841,49919,49942,50008,50016,50307,50372,50426,50478,51281,51370,53943,56042,57214,57622,57919,57920,57923,58005,58639,58644,58849,59938,59939,60193,60243,60832,61672,61680,61822,61960,62187,62415,63051,63272,63748,64080,65125,65155,65583,66737,67757,68735,68939,69051,69056,69231,69885,70222,70247,70250,70964,71089,71876,71987,72123,72135,72885,73439,73453,73552,73651,76602,77330,78004,78216,78286,78481,78482,78484,78590,78697,78718,79059,79552,79786,79840,79914,79954,80295,80666,81487,83509,83783,85089,85959,86045,89817,91476,97983,98009,98240,98278,98569,108251,109480,111548,113889,120809,122082,122508,122534,123397,123599,124644,127641,132153],"name":"Disney","slug":"disney","updated_at":1506556800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/disney","checksum":"df672d2f-6926-5223-d03e-11a37c1290e1"},"cover":{"id":88350,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":122534,"height":727,"image_id":"co1w66","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1w66.jpg","width":545,"checksum":"962a51f6-f86e-610c-b29d-5b578d21ffab"},"first_release_date":1161043200,"franchises":[{"id":26,"created_at":1341100800,"games":[540,542,1166,1509,1510,2473,2926,2933,3254,3467,3849,3880,3881,3882,3883,3886,3887,4747,4806,4807,4809,4811,4812,5212,5218,5240,5241,6487,6756,6765,7220,7356,7654,8118,8122,8123,8124,8125,8126,8127,8128,8129,8130,11083,11495,11963,12122,12910,12921,13379,17753,17818,19097,19212,19248,19900,20627,21086,23792,24952,25912,27791,30977,30979,36228,36312,42489,43375,43737,44013,44025,44065,44764,45043,45780,46431,46434,46673,47788,47789,47790,47822,47844,48992,49153,49190,49202,49261,49282,49404,49405,49406,49407,49410,49411,49478,49919,49922,49942,50016,50099,50307,50426,50478,50681,50687,51281,51375,55072,57214,57622,57919,57920,57923,58005,59938,59939,60243,60692,61960,62415,63272,63748,65583,65604,66270,66851,66982,68939,69051,69056,69885,70247,70308,70964,71630,71876,71987,72032,72123,72885,73439,73453,74101,74108,74426,77330,78216,78286,78482,78483,78484,78590,78641,79718,79813,79840,79914,79954,81206,81487,83509,83783,85089,86045,89817,91476,92058,96138,97983,98009,98240,98278,98558,108251,109480,113889,115332,116973,120809,122082,122508,122534,123397,123599,124644,127640,127641,132096],"name":"Disney","slug":"disney","updated_at":1341100800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/disney","checksum":"b3e2eec4-c136-0d9a-7428-a10cc07d6789"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":85075,"company":{"id":789,"name":"Buena Vista Games","slug":"buena-vista-games"}},{"id":89838,"company":{"id":1021,"logo":{"id":1143,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":198,"image_id":"ninwrlqesu20eb8jhqaa","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ninwrlqesu20eb8jhqaa.jpg","width":940,"checksum":"4143b28c-d987-ccb6-7bb2-25aff1c77cdf"},"name":"WayForward Technologies Inc.","slug":"wayforward-technologies-inc"}}],"name":"Disney's American Dragon: Jake Long - Attack of the Dark Dragon","platforms":[20],"release_dates":[{"id":184304,"category":0,"created_at":1578268800,"date":1161043200,"game":122534,"human":"Oct 17, 2006","m":10,"platform":20,"region":2,"updated_at":1578268800,"y":2006,"checksum":"460f5eac-9a22-92cf-eb60-452f28bfdc44"}],"slug":"disneys-american-dragon-jake-long-attack-of-the-dark-dragon","summary":"Disney's American Dragon: Jake Long is based on the Disney Channel show.

Machigai Museum?) is a video game for the Nintendo DS developed by Namco Bandai. It is designed similar to games such as Brain Age which uses simple brain teaser to exercise reflexes and brain function. It is a part of Nintendo's Touch! Generations brand. \n \nThe game: \nThe game projects two images, the correct one on the top screen, and an error filled one on the bottom screen. Comparing the two images, the player has to locate and find the inaccuracies or changes from the top screen to the touch screen. \n \nConcept: \nThis game is based on the traditional game spot the difference. GamePro.com described the game \"like a mix between Where's Waldo and the Hidden Pictures section in Highlights magazine\". \n \nControls: \nThe players use none of the face buttons or D-Pad on the DS. The entire game is played using the touch screen and stylus. The player draws a circle using the stylus when the player spots the difference between the top image on the bottom screen. In some instances, the built in microphone is used. \n \nModes and gameplay: \nRapid Play: In this game there is one difference in the two images, which the player is tested to find and circle as fast as you can. This keeps on repeating at a quick pace until the timer runs out. \nFocused Mode: Only working with one set of pictures, the player finds a number of things different in each picture. Once the player find them all or when time runs out, the player complete the stage. \nToday Fortune: A daily routine practiced in the game. The player selects a category, health, work, romance, or money, only one each per day. Then they play a trimmed down version of the Rapid Play mode. . At the end, the game calculates the player's fortune depending on the specific choices he or she made for each picture. \n \nMultiplayer: \nQuickSpot uses DS Download Play with support for up to eight players. Two exclusive modes appear in this mode that are not playable in the single player game. \n \nTime Bomb: \nA hot potato type mode for up to eight players. The players simply pass the DS around to the next player once the previous player solves the current puzzle. The player left holding the DS when the bomb explodes loses. \nScramble Mode A Multi-DS Cart mode that has up to three players competing at the same puzzles. The player who circles the fastest is the winner, however those on the losing end can eventually build up a meter that gives them access to unique power-ups. This varies from turning an opponent's screen into a negative view or obscure an opponent's screen by sending a swarm of frogs across the screen.","total_rating":58.5,"total_rating_count":3,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/quickspot"},{"id":91666,"cover":{"id":73817,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":91666,"height":575,"image_id":"co1kyh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1kyh.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"5795a869-e24f-b2c4-7250-e70cab7808dd"},"first_release_date":1254182400,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"name":"Sideswiped","platforms":[20],"release_dates":[{"id":168753,"category":0,"created_at":1556150400,"date":1254182400,"game":91666,"human":"Sep 29, 2009","m":9,"platform":20,"region":2,"updated_at":1556496000,"y":2009,"checksum":"48910df2-7b28-04e7-b90c-b8829e0344a9"}],"slug":"sideswiped","summary":"Buckle up!

Just like the renowned PC version, TrackMania DS offers a track editor that lets you create your own unique and exciting tracks from hundreds of different design blocks, giving the game near-infinite replay value.","total_rating":79.375,"total_rating_count":7,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/trackmania-ds"},{"id":20696,"collection":{"id":719,"created_at":1391299200,"games":[2661,4802,6755,20696,20699],"name":"Deca

We tower above them and go about our business completely unaware of the war waged at our feet. After the comet had passed, the scientists concluded that the strange, green dust had no effect on the world. No one noticed that tiny plants and fungi were acting strangely. \n\nMushrooms, cacti, flowers and vines had awakened to full consciousness. Tribes quickly formed, building plant and fungi nations and with nation building… came war! Mushroom Men shows gamers the mundane world from the surreal perspective of a three inch high Mushroom Man.

Since then Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. has grown into an international company focused on creating video game products across modern console platforms. NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

Players will enjoy the game while developing the powers of thinking, utilising their existing knowledge and experience. This game transforms basic curiosity into powerful thinking. \n \nMinDStorm, from developer ASK Co. Ltd., takes brain exercise software to a new level and offers a whole raft of exciting new games, features and challenges all designed specifically to stimulate and improve the player's brain functions and most importantly, be fun to play in their own right. \n \nTransform gaming curiosity into powerful thinking with MinDStorm. The game features ten distinct types of challenge for players, all of which are simple to pick up and play using the Nintendo DS stylus, touch screen and microphone. Each of MinDStorm's challenges is designed to focus on enhancing the player's reason, endurance, analysis, intuition or observation. Regardless of the type of game chosen, extended play results in improved overall brain function and enhanced memory. \n \nA first for the brain training genre, MinDStorm throws additional challenges and problems into the mix. Players are rewarded with ever more complex riddles to solve as they do well in the main training mode. General knowledge and geography-based challenges are also included to accompany the more abstract trials such as sliding picture puzzles, mazes to navigate with the stylus and spot the difference games. \n \nFurther innovation is found in the way the game will adapt the tasks it asks players to perform according to the local environment it is being played in.

Ouendan stars a cheer squad rhythmically cheering for various troubled people, presented in game in the style of a manga comic. In each stage, players use the DS touchscreen to tap specifically marked spots that appear in rhythm to various Japanese pop songs, scoring points for accurate timing and avoiding a poor performance which can cause the stage to end prematurely. Though never released in Western markets, it was a popular import to these regions, leading to the development of the Westernized spiritual sequel Elite Beat Agents, as well as a direct Japanese sequel Moero!

It has previously been released in Japan under the name ぼくは航空管制官 (I Am An Air Traffic Controller), and later in Europe under the title Air Traffic Controller by DS. A video game demo was made available before its release for the Wii's Nintendo Channel. \n \nAir Traffic Chaos involves the player taking control of an airport control tower for a period. During this period the player needs to achieve a certain score based on orders given to planes and safe take offs and landings. The game has a total of 15 challenges.[1] \n \nThe airports in Air Traffic Chaos are all 5 international and domestic Japanese airports. They are: \n \nFukuoka Airport \nKansai International Airport \nChubu Centrair International Airport \nTokyo International Airport \nNew Chitose Airport \n[1] These each have 3 stages ranging from easy, medium and expert difficulty. Each stage increases in difficulty and brings with it a longer shift with more aircraft to safely land and depart. \n \nThere is no multiplayer gaming but the player can share his/her results and badges records with up to 7 other players through the ATC Library.","total_rating":60,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/air-traffic-chaos"},{"id":20520,"collection":{"id":2267,"created_at":1468800000,"games":[20511,20512,20513,20514,20515,20516,20517,20518,20519,20520],"name":"Kawa no Nushi Tsuri","slug":"kawa-no-nushi-tsuri","updated_at":1468800000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/kawa-no-nushi-tsuri","checksum":"f2c8129c-8182-08e6-6335-aa7d2e772188"},"first_release_date":1211414400,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":85150,"company":{"id":782,"description":"Marvelous Entertainment (株式会社 マーベラスエンターテイメント) (MMV) is a multinational corporation that produces animation, music, video games, television series.

Every day people come to you with their animals, guinea pigs, rabbits, budgerigars, cats, dogs and even horses. Sometimes it can even be necessary to accommodate the animals and take care of them for a couple of days, so that they get well and happy again quickly. Therefore you can build extra stables and accomodations. Feeding, playing with the pets, bear company, but also cleaning up and the daily treatment are your duties. For very demanding horse-patients, you can experience interesting things about horse whispering. But although the work with pets is a lot of fun, even the best vet doctor needs some time out. Then you take your own horse and go for a long ride at the beach, on meadows and fields or through the nearby forest.

Similar to games like Earthbound, enemy encounters are seen as actual enemies that players can avoid or attempt to strike early. The actual battles are a combination of turn-based menu attacks, and timed reactions to enemies during battle. By watching the way an enemy reacts, you can anticipate their attack and avoid it or counterattack.","total_rating":92.70854027528455,"total_rating_count":70,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mario-luigi-bowser-s-inside-story"},{"id":47980,"cover":{"id":70870,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":47980,"height":445,"image_id":"co1iom","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1iom.jpg","width":496,"checksum":"181cbff9-c853-5475-646e-bf51da551d43"},"first_release_date":1257811200,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":73166,"company":{"id":2151,"name":"Jet Black Games","slug":"jet-black-games"}}],"name":"Style Lab Makeover","platforms":[20],"release_dates":[{"id":163658,"category":0,"created_at":1547596800,"date":1257811200,"game":47980,"human":"Nov 10, 2009","m":11,"platform":20,"region":8,"updated_at":1547596800,"y":2009,"checksum":"ecf89670-cd2e-b67b-1243-f690e62e2e0c"}],"screenshots":[{"id":277123,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":47980,"height":293,"image_id":"sc5xtv","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5xtv.jpg","width":196,"checksum":"3f800ac0-4057-5174-d5d0-35a391dcaae3"},{"id":277124,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":47980,"height":293,"image_id":"sc5xtw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5xtw.jpg","width":196,"checksum":"07e7cad9-7804-c305-9e5d-e66d29a2ec10"},{"id":277125,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":47980,"height":293,"image_id":"sc5xtx","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5xtx.jpg","width":196,"checksum":"e60c4387-0deb-1ae9-4852-3a462ad4f8d2"},{"id":277126,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":47980,"height":293,"image_id":"sc5xty","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5xty.jpg","width":196,"checksum":"0c499622-08af-bace-d7c6-4155c28e7baf"},{"id":277127,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":47980,"height":293,"image_id":"sc5xtz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5xtz.jpg","width":197,"checksum":"ec3377e4-25d3-c00f-59e2-f9a9d4400f01"}],"slug":"style-lab-makeover","summary":"Play with your style! \n \nTake your picture with the Nintendo DSi camera and use it to create your very own face in the game!

It was first released in Japan, and was later released in North America, Australia, Europe, and other regions. It was originally released in three different versions: Dachshund & Friends, Lab & Friends (Shiba & Friends in Japan), and Chihuahua & Friends. It has been re-released twice since then, first as a bundled release with a special edition Nintendo DS with a new version called Nintendogs: Best Friends, and then later as Nintendogs: Dalmatian & Friends. \n \nNintendogs uses the DS's touchscreen and built-in microphone. The touch screen allows the player to pet a dog, as well as to use various items that can be found or purchased. These range from balls and frisbees, to toys, to grooming supplies to keep the dogs happy. The microphone is used to call to the player's dog by speaking the name given to the dog in the beginning of the game as well as to teach the dog tricks such as \"sit\" or \"roll over\". Players can bring their dogs on walks and to the park if they so choose. They may interact with other players in multi-player by using the DS's wireless linkup. It also uses the DS's internal clock and calendar to allow the dog to grow hungrier or dirtier based on the elapsed time. \n \nNintendogs received critical acclaim. It has an aggregate score of 85% at Game Rankings,[3] and has won many awards, including the 2006 Innovation Award from PC World and Best Handheld Game from the Associated Press. As of March 31, 2015, all versions of Nintendogs combined have sold 23.96 million copies worldwide, making it second on the Nintendo DS best-sellers list, behind only New Super Mario Bros.[4] Because of Nintendogs' success, Nintendo has made several related products, including Nintendogs toys[5] and a series of Nintendogs trading cards.[6] At E3 2010, it was announced a sequel, titled Nintendogs + Cats, would be released for the Nintendo 3DS.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nintendogs-lab-and-friends"},{"id":81426,"cover":{"id":110816,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":81426,"height":800,"image_id":"co2di8","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2di8.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"dacb101f-1ddc-db34-6bef-1af32969cd48"},"first_release_date":1214784000,"involved_companies":[{"id":84024,"company":{"id":197,"description":"THQ Inc. is a leading worldwide developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software.

Thingys! Humans, succumbing to ray-guns, mind-control, and shiny flying saucers, have failed to defend their planet and let it fall easily into the clutches of the Big Brain and his army of Brain Thingys. The only hope left for mankind is three Teenage Zombies that have arisen from a graveyard disturbed in the invasion. The undead trio ignores their normal human victims in favor of the pulsing pink brains they see EVERYWHERE - all the while being lured to the ultimate lunch: THE BIG BRAIN! The Big Brain soon refocuses his efforts and resources to battle the Earth's greatest champions: The Teenage Zombies! \n \nTeenage Zombies uses a whimsical style that focuses on, and parodies the Zombie genre, as well as 1950s style Science Fiction. This is presented in a comic book look featuring comic book panels, dialogue boxes and story telling. Gameplay involves side-scrolling adventures opening up to stylus mini-games, double-screen boss battles, and brain busting puzzle challenges.","total_rating":57.5,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/teenage-zombies-invasion-of-the-alien-brain-thingys"},{"id":54163,"cover":{"id":61878,"game":54163,"height":449,"image_id":"amwdasfosiivagmprxhf","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/amwdasfosiivagmprxhf.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"58b7a4ec-5951-a544-6086-0bf0f9a507ce"},"first_release_date":1247788800,"involved_companies":[{"id":61149,"company":{"id":423,"description":"Deep Silver develops and distributes interactive games for all platforms.

The games add many new features, such as Internet play over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and changes to battle mechanics and Pokémon Contests, along with addition of 107 new Pokémon.

Nanashi no Geemu Me?, lit. \"Nameless Game: Eye\") is a survival horror video game for the Nintendo DS, and the sequel to the original Nanashi no Game. It was developed by Epics, published by Square Enix, and released on August 27, 2009 in Japan. The story follows an anthropology student from Nanto University, as he discovers two cursed games, an RPG and a platformer. The game's title refers to the protagonist's left eye, represented by the left screen of the DS when held sideways, which allows the player to see things left (and hidden) by the curse. It sold 15,000 copies on the week of its release. \n \nMuch like in the original, Nanashi no Game: Me involves two separate modes of play. Most of the game takes place in the real world, where the player navigates real-time 3D environments using the DS's D-Pad and Touch Screen. While exploring, the player must solve puzzles and reach locations. The player can switch to the TS Menu at any time, where they can play the cursed game, read e-mail messages, and load a previous save file. In many cases, an e-mail message or update to the cursed game will interrupt the player's exploration.

Stories tell of a land of yore, now shrouded by centuries of time forgotten, called Ys. Despite its great knowledge, endless wealth, and bountiful prosperity, a sudden and unexpected cataclysm devastated the realm. Soon, its memory had faded completely from the minds of man. Centuries later, a young adventurer named Adol set sail to explore the world and leave his mark on history. During his travels, he learned of the tragic tale of Esteria, a once prosperous island now inexplicably engulfed by a crippling storm. Adol plotted a course for the besieged isle, curious to unravel the mystery... Available to North American audiences for the first time, this ultimate translation delivers the most substantial version of the famous Ys story ever made. Two games in one, Ys was released separately overseas, but North American gamers get them together. One of the longest-running, most beloved action RPGs of all-time, Ys has features exclusive to DS including 3D graphics, multiplayer, touch support, and more.","total_rating":38.5,"total_rating_count":5,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/legacy-of-ys-books-i-and-ii"},{"id":24262,"collection":{"id":984,"created_at":1402012800,"games":[24262,27124,42740,42755,42756,44666,49699,51537,67708,70699,82105,104981,104982,113100,116000],"name":"Atelier","slug":"atelier","updated_at":1402012800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/atelier","checksum":"2ae8c92c-6647-ef68-371d-e6980845a27a"},"cover":{"id":18891,"game":24262,"height":578,"image_id":"orunjg1kmkw6bsxurfbe","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/orunjg1kmkw6bsxurfbe.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"fa7628a1-9b9c-e907-e807-610768553148"},"first_release_date":1236816000,"franchises":[{"id":900,"created_at":1478736000,"games":[7275,7276,7277,7278,7279,11513,12633,19634,20510,20996,21406,24262,24320,25699,25921,26180,26439,26440,26441,26514,26515,27121,27122,36814,36855,103335,105030,105031,105032,106294,111330,119061,121224,122748,122749,122750,125186],"name":"Atelier","slug":"atelier","updated_at":1478736000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/atelier","checksum":"6eb36dcb-4f02-e7b8-2176-808a046cda30"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":41863,"company":{"id":3046,"description":"Gust (株式会社ガスト) is a Japanese developer and publisher of video games, known for their Atelier and Ar tonelico series.

NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003.

The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

GT is the first game in which racing sim and RPG come together to create an exceptional mix of fantasy and fun. These two elements have been developed to offer the gamer a new experience that goes beyond a simple race on a track. The core of the game is an innovative career mode that allows the virtual driver to evolve, from his first races to the maximum level of professionalism. \nThe gamer has the ability to customise the driver by going through the typical phases of character creation, typical of RPGs, such as improving his skills starting from the driver attitude: aggressivity, intuition, imperturbability and reliability. By joining a team, each driver will develop his own driving style, thus influencing his own growth. \nImproving the driver and making him first of the class will require top driving abilities and Gabriele Tarquini, the Italian champion, will be fundamental with his tips on how to improve his driving technique. \nIt's possible to hone the driver's skills by playing with the different game modes. \nCareer (or Season) Mode consists in a series of races on different tracks but the driver's growth is not so linear. Each race allows collecting experience points and victory gives the best score. Opponents too will do the same and it's important not to let them through. Challenges consist in 27 specific trials divided into 9 categories, they are all very challenging and directed towards the improvement of a specific skill associated to the driver. Winning challenges is a key factor to maintaining your driver competitive. \nQuick races are completely arcade races, meaning that there won't be any customisable car asset, although the driver's skills will influence his driving. \nPractice is an experience which allows getting abilities and equipment for the driver and can be either a race against opponents or against time. In split screen multiplayer mode the gamer can choose between a single race, a championship or Survivor mode. A Championship is a variety of races that the gamer can choose. \nThe realism of the game is very immersive and the stress and the pressure from the opponents can be felt but thanks to the Tiger Effect it's possible to go back in time and correct an error. \nAll this is topped with spectacular sceneries which make Evolution GT a unique game in its genre: fluidity of the game in all its locations, circuits or urban streets, the variety of sceneries, London, Berlin, Barcelona, Milan and Florence, countryside streets in the Cote Azure and the Scottish Highlands, Hockenheim and Donington, the details and the variety of cars such as Alfa Romeo, Audi, Bugatti, Chevrolet, Mercedes, Opel, Pagani, Pontiac, Renault, SEAT, TVR, Vauxhall and Volkswagen. \n35 officially licensed cars, all with damage system.","total_rating":26,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/evolution-gt"},{"id":67883,"collection":{"id":2294,"created_at":1469232000,"games":[20481,21049,41412,41413,41414,47772,48883,49852,55863,67367,67883,67884,77057,78265,78561,78906,78907,79245,79453,80091,80147,106286],"name":"Jake Hunter","slug":"jake-hunter","updated_at":1469232000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/jake-hunter","checksum":"b8c8b3e7-e363-21df-b73d-854d7cbaea6e"},"cover":{"id":106620,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":67883,"height":1176,"image_id":"co2a9o","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2a9o.jpg","width":882,"checksum":"94b6ce88-1d76-6c78-885e-c24424ede6a2"},"first_release_date":1237420800,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":102272,"company":{"id":23059,"name":"WorkJam","slug":"workjam"}},{"id":102273,"company":{"id":1218,"description":"Arc System Works is a video game developer and publisher originating in Yokohama, Japan and was founded by Minoru Kidooka in 1988.

At its heart, the game is about the player living in a small town and communicating with the other villagers while raising livestock, harvesting crops, and building a farm. Aside from laying out fields and deciding where to herd the animals, players must also pay attention to the placement of their resources, arranging their life as they see fit. As a special feature unique to the DS, interaction with others is a major part of the game. One can even court, date and marry. It's just one goal in a game filled with things to do and people to meet. The game is beautifully animated in a Japanese anime style.

It is a collection of: \n \nSonic the Hedgehog. \nSonic the Hedgehog 2. \nSonic the Hedgehog 3. \nSonic & Knuckles (With Sonic 3 and Knuckles, and Knuckles in Sonic 2). \n \nThis compilation was officially announced on December 2, 2009 by Sega of America and was released March 2, 2010, although news of this compilation first broke when it was classified by the Australian Government's OFLC. It features two extra lock-on modes from the originals, which allows the player to play as Knuckles in Sonic 2 and to play the complete version of Sonic 3 (titled \"Knuckles in Sonic 3\" as opposed to the original \"Sonic 3 & Knuckles\" title). The games receive the addition of a save option; while players can \"save anywhere\" as billed, they must restart the act in which they saved - they are, however, allowed to keep their score and Chaos Emeralds from when they saved, as well as any extra lives and continues earned. The collection also includes a gallery of images. \n \nIt was originally supposed to also include Sonic Spinball, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, and Sonic 3D Blast but none of those three games made it into the final product. \n \nThe game was met with mixed to positive reactions from critics, receiving a 70 out of 100 on Metacritic. Praise was directed at the quality of the games included, but was criticized for its lack of a multiplayer mode and how the artwork included was the only extras included.","total_rating":70.5,"total_rating_count":5,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-classic-collection"},{"id":85627,"first_release_date":1240963200,"involved_companies":[{"id":61063,"company":{"id":1215,"description":"Banpresto Co., Ltd. is a Japanese toy company, and a former game developer and publishing, headquartered in the Shinagawa Seaside West Building in Shinagawa, Tokyo.","logo":{"id":1423,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":545,"image_id":"rpxhbw50ussrl5z3qon6","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rpxhbw50ussrl5z3qon6.jpg","width":1200,"checksum":"99f5f2a6-8708-6cd5-c811-d9c5b7985c34"},"name":"Banpresto","slug":"banpresto"}}],"name":"Infinite Frontier Super Robot Wars OG Saga","platforms":[20],"rating":63,"rating_count":0,"release_dates":[{"id":140272,"category":0,"created_at":1517529600,"date":1240963200,"game":85627,"human":"Apr 29, 2009","m":4,"platform":20,"region":2,"updated_at":1517788800,"y":2009,"checksum":"c09de118-c174-ac51-4a3a-38411215e7d4"}],"slug":"infinite-frontier-super-robot-wars-og-saga","total_rating":63,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/infinite-frontier-super-robot-wars-og-saga"},{"id":21267,"collection":{"id":187,"created_at":1320192000,"games":[836,837,2437,2438,2468,2472,3164,3165,20485,21267,21715,21797,22020,22565,45292,59596],"name":"Prince of Persia","slug":"prince-of-persia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/prince-of-persia","checksum":"b2c4b2d7-4c7b-20c1-a490-d785d65d88f9"},"cover":{"id":110678,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":21267,"height":800,"image_id":"co2dee","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dee.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"c2633527-81c5-ae21-e562-8ff9edcdc720"},"first_release_date":1228176000,"franchises":[{"id":495,"created_at":1417046400,"games":[836,837,2437,2438,2468,2472,21267,43003],"name":"Prince of Persia","slug":"prince-of-persia","updated_at":1417046400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/prince-of-persia","checksum":"ed26f359-f545-6779-b094-418412e02f77"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":40723,"company":{"id":898,"logo":{"id":818,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":1245,"image_id":"ywne1nnq0lexoxaprawp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ywne1nnq0lexoxaprawp.jpg","width":1500,"checksum":"0cf82fbb-bfdf-631c-7fb6-a867d45a9d94"},"name":"Ubisoft Casablanca","slug":"ubisoft-casablanca"}}],"name":"Prince of Persia: The Fallen King","platforms":[20],"rating":51,"rating_count":2,"release_dates":[{"id":59020,"category":0,"created_at":1476403200,"date":1228176000,"game":21267,"human":"Dec 02, 2008","m":12,"platform":20,"region":2,"updated_at":1476403200,"y":2008,"checksum":"17939e2a-677e-ae88-386b-2355c1d17ce8"},{"id":59021,"category":0,"created_at":1476403200,"date":1228435200,"game":21267,"human":"Dec 05, 2008","m":12,"platform":20,"region":1,"updated_at":1476403200,"y":2008,"checksum":"ac80463b-5d40-8e09-a938-c937b7bd045b"}],"screenshots":[{"id":28677,"game":21267,"height":192,"image_id":"ch7pjthdpnlhnaoosvms","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ch7pjthdpnlhnaoosvms.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"4629319d-3c4d-b238-7288-dfefbc106e27"}],"slug":"prince-of-persia-the-fallen-king","summary":"Prince of Persia: The Fallen King is a third-person action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Casablanca.[1] The game was released for the Nintendo DS in December 2008, as a spin-off of Prince of Persia.

The game was published in 1988 by Elite Systems Ltd for home computers. \n \nThe player takes control of the character Lion-O and maneuvers him through 14 side scrolling levels to search for the missing Eye of Thundera. Lion-O begins the game equipped with the Sword of Omens (with the Eye of Thundera missing from the hilt) but has the option to switch throughout the game between the sword and a short range energy gun. In several levels, Lion-O will jump into a flying vehicle that can fire in a similar manner as the short range energy gun. The first four levels of the game are a part of the Garden of the Elementals, where the player may choose the order they play each of the themed levels, consisting of fire, water, air, and earth. \n \nEach level has a time limit to complete it; when it expires, Mumm-Ra appears and more goons and villains appear to make it tougher for Lion-O to finish.","total_rating":47,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/thundercats"},{"id":47805,"cover":{"id":61752,"game":47805,"height":897,"image_id":"v9g3bslanhznvzqn5wqd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v9g3bslanhznvzqn5wqd.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"d2e49db6-d225-4756-fef9-f45d832b102e"},"first_release_date":1166227200,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":60995,"company":{"id":263,"logo":{"id":79,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":120,"image_id":"b48ufwml6vyzdgcofk2h","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b48ufwml6vyzdgcofk2h.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"3e75f024-8366-2b46-3a5c-288f82169e33"},"name":"Namco","slug":"namco"}}],"name":"Gunpey DS","platforms":[20],"rating":50,"rating_count":0,"release_dates":[{"id":94446,"category":0,"created_at":1500249600,"date":1166227200,"game":47805,"human":"Dec 16, 2006","m":12,"platform":20,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":2006,"checksum":"1b741baa-e126-ccec-b5bd-d6f40073101f"},{"id":140013,"category":0,"created_at":1517529600,"date":1175212800,"game":47805,"human":"Mar 30, 2007","m":3,"platform":20,"region":1,"updated_at":1517788800,"y":2007,"checksum":"b66a8948-1e3a-6b3b-06f2-564d19a6d8b6"}],"screenshots":[{"id":160781,"game":47805,"height":384,"image_id":"gfz3kgxlcjxbqlssn0i5","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gfz3kgxlcjxbqlssn0i5.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"5ecd54de-7387-3f1a-3aa6-63104d3dd7ce"},{"id":160782,"game":47805,"height":384,"image_id":"y5rdmmb7d7cnrhoctdum","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y5rdmmb7d7cnrhoctdum.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"bf2feadd-19ae-080f-79b0-2969a567212b"},{"id":160783,"game":47805,"height":378,"image_id":"sfzzy4niv6thf1wn5e70","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sfzzy4niv6thf1wn5e70.jpg","width":252,"checksum":"2d8f76a9-bdbd-fedc-a968-fb18b35eee17"},{"id":160784,"game":47805,"height":378,"image_id":"bmy5jopof1xlirv88d6n","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bmy5jopof1xlirv88d6n.jpg","width":252,"checksum":"f7e5296d-0809-21d5-2fc6-d8705a65b5d2"}],"slug":"gunpey-ds","summary":"Gunpey (グンペイ?), often written as \"Gun Pey\" or \"GunPey\", is a series of handheld puzzle games released by Bandai.

Any ghost created with the ink ends up just as mischievous as the magician. Ink ghosts have invaded books and paintings, causing trouble within those realms, and now it's up to Pac-Man to wipe out the ghost problem by using the \"Ghost Pen,\" a device that allows him to enter the infested books and paintings to clear out the bad guys. Pac-Pix is a game tailored specifically for the Nintendo DS' system capabilities. By drawing Pac-Man characters in a specific fashion (the mouth first, then the circle, all in one swoop), the drawing will come to life and munch anything in his path. Players can maneuver Pac-Man drawings in different directions by plotting pathways on the screen for the scribble to follow.","total_rating":77.33333333333334,"total_rating_count":5,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pac-pix"},{"id":20763,"cover":{"id":56142,"game":20763,"height":400,"image_id":"etbq8xddpptlfujddzdl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/etbq8xddpptlfujddzdl.jpg","width":445,"checksum":"47ec0ae1-a78d-f3be-ee8a-73f4d7ca67ea"},"first_release_date":1217894400,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":61454,"company":{"id":115,"description":"Codemasters is a British video game developer and publisher founded by David Darling and his brother Richard in 1986.

New Era mode: the simple rules of Space Invaders are expanded and twisted into a revolutionary step for the classic franchise. New Era mode takes the form of a world tour, with the player confronting the Space Invaders at 20 recognisable geographical locations. In total there are 60 levels to defend and 13 different types of invader to battle. Power-ups include protective shields, additional support craft, rapid-fire shots and column-clearing laser beams - essential aides as the action becomes progressively more intense. Power-ups can be used in combination: using support craft with laser results in three laser beams, decimating multiple waves of invaders with every press of the fire button.","total_rating":43.5,"total_rating_count":3,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/space-invaders-revolution"},{"id":65155,"collection":{"id":2986,"created_at":1506556800,"games":[360,2361,2473,2926,3006,3166,3613,3782,3883,3884,3885,3886,3887,4066,4234,4406,4666,4806,5218,5254,5261,6200,6434,6589,6756,8067,8127,8130,8144,8149,8150,8151,8152,8163,8446,8447,8452,9056,10610,10662,10791,12052,12122,12826,12910,13379,17172,17753,17765,17829,18102,18142,19004,19212,19218,19761,19900,20390,20542,20627,21086,22325,22468,23586,24979,25911,27791,30977,36227,36312,40638,40695,43375,43499,43724,43737,43895,44013,44025,44839,44877,45043,45228,45564,45575,46210,46233,46431,46434,46446,46673,47392,47728,47753,47789,47790,47859,47868,48992,49153,49186,49190,49202,49275,49278,49282,49304,49339,49376,49404,49405,49406,49407,49409,49410,49478,49494,49841,49919,49942,50008,50016,50307,50372,50426,50478,51281,51370,53943,56042,57214,57622,57919,57920,57923,58005,58639,58644,58849,59938,59939,60193,60243,60832,61672,61680,61822,61960,62187,62415,63051,63272,63748,64080,65125,65155,65583,66737,67757,68735,68939,69051,69056,69231,69885,70222,70247,70250,70964,71089,71876,71987,72123,72135,72885,73439,73453,73552,73651,76602,77330,78004,78216,78286,78481,78482,78484,78590,78697,78718,79059,79552,79786,79840,79914,79954,80295,80666,81487,83509,83783,85089,85959,86045,89817,91476,97983,98009,98240,98278,98569,108251,109480,111548,113889,120809,122082,122508,122534,123397,123599,124644,127641,132153],"name":"Disney","slug":"disney","updated_at":1506556800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/disney","checksum":"df672d2f-6926-5223-d03e-11a37c1290e1"},"cover":{"id":46018,"game":65155,"height":300,"image_id":"j0br0ihilzi45c63j8nc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j0br0ihilzi45c63j8nc.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"45d90274-14c0-7c9e-d380-bf7a5caf5a1f"},"first_release_date":1256601600,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Tinkerbell and the Lost Treasure","platforms":[20],"release_dates":[{"id":161665,"category":0,"created_at":1543622400,"date":1256601600,"game":65155,"human":"Oct 27, 2009","m":10,"platform":20,"region":2,"updated_at":1543622400,"y":2009,"checksum":"cee80331-83b3-8afc-2503-1b56474eaead"}],"slug":"tinkerbell-and-the-lost-treasure","summary":"A game geared towards girls for the Didj.

The game's protagonist, Ashley Mizuki Robbins, is the daughter of Richard and Sayoko Robbins, researchers of human memory. After her parents mysteriously went missing in 1994, they were presumed dead.Consequently, Ashley was raised by her father's younger sister, Jessica Robbins, in the suburbs of Seattle. Eleven years later, two days before her fourteenth birthday, Ashley receives a package from her father containing a birthday card and a device called a DAS. The DAS, programmed to respond only to Ashley's biometrics, contains a message from her father, claiming that he is waiting for her on Blood Edward Island. \nAssuming control of Ashley Robbins, players navigate through 3D environments and attempt to solve puzzles. During movement, the touchscreen displays an aerial view of Ashley and her surroundings. The player can move Ashley using a point and click system, dragging the stylus across the screen, or using the D-pad. The top screen shows pre-rendered images of the player's current location. To solve puzzles encountered in the game, the player must use the touchscreen, or other DS capabilities, such as the DS microphone.","total_rating":65.20207450776415,"total_rating_count":9,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/another-code-two-memories"},{"id":70699,"collection":{"id":984,"created_at":1402012800,"games":[24262,27124,42740,42755,42756,44666,49699,51537,67708,70699,82105,104981,104982,113100,116000],"name":"Atelier","slug":"atelier","updated_at":1402012800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/atelier","checksum":"2ae8c92c-6647-ef68-371d-e6980845a27a"},"cover":{"id":66903,"game":70699,"height":500,"image_id":"j06sudm56udn2rjzwjs2","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j06sudm56udn2rjzwjs2.jpg","width":555,"checksum":"105340f9-2825-2a4e-4adf-02cd77d407a7"},"first_release_date":1176940800,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":66224,"company":{"id":3046,"description":"Gust (株式会社ガスト) is a Japanese developer and publisher of video games, known for their Atelier and Ar tonelico series.

There is a clandestine group, under the guise of scholarly research, plotting to resurrect a goddess whose time has long since passed. To achieve this goal, they need two things; a vessel of flesh and blood to house the spirit of the goddess, and the lives of every living being offered up as a sacrifice. It is against the backdrop of this coming chaos that Ares, an orphan from a small, forgotten village, sets out to seek his fortune as an adventurer. At the start of his journey, he encounters a beautiful young girl with mysterious powers named Shiera, who has not only lost her memories about herself, but also of the world around her.

Although graphically 3D, its 2D gameplay made it similar to titles such as New Super Mario Bros. or Sonic Rush. Using the two-screen display of the Nintendo DS, flying monsters appear on the top screen, while grounded monsters appear on the bottom screen. A multi-player option allows for a different player to control each monster. \n \nCritical reaction to Double Smash was largely negative. IGN gave the game a score of 3 out of 10, saying: \"None of the recent Godzilla games have been very good, but at least they were fun. Godzilla Unleashed: Double Smash cannot make this claim. It looks terrible, and reduces the King of the Monsters to a mush of no-texture polygons, then puts him in a tedious series of punching planes and kicking boats.\" GameSpot gave Double Smash a 2 out of 10, calling it \"one of the worst DS games ever made,\" adding: \"With a perfect storm of terrible game design, bad play mechanics, and uninspired destruction, this game does what oxidation bombs, volcanoes, and Matthew Broderick couldn't: It kills Godzilla.\" GameSpy gave the game a 1 out of 5, saying: \"This brain-dead combat is perhaps the worst part of Double Smash. Slowly plodding through the stale levels, fighting the same enemies, and using the same techniques to win grows old almost immediately.\"","total_rating":35,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/godzilla-unleashed-double-smash"},{"id":2782,"collection":{"id":535,"created_at":1374883200,"games":[2778,2779,2780,2781,2782],"name":"Tak","slug":"tak","updated_at":1374883200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/tak","checksum":"d7c94690-ea9f-c2a8-d479-5bc287336532"},"cover":{"id":2747,"game":2782,"height":230,"image_id":"yunfgaje6qj5ib1fyogc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yunfgaje6qj5ib1fyogc.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"eb40a774-f37e-7e0f-be37-5bac0764fde2"},"first_release_date":1223856000,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":6679,"company":{"id":197,"description":"THQ Inc. is a leading worldwide developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software.

It was originally released in three different versions: Dachshund & Friends, Lab & Friends (Shiba & Friends in Japan), and Chihuahua & Friends. It has been re-released twice since then, first as a bundled release with a special edition Nintendo DS with a new version called Nintendogs: Best Friends, and then later as Nintendogs: Dalmatian & Friends. \n \nNintendogs uses the DS's touchscreen and built-in microphone. The touch screen allows the player to pet a dog, as well as to use various items that can be found or purchased. These range from balls and frisbees, to toys, to grooming supplies to keep the dogs happy. The microphone is used to call to the player's dog by speaking the name given to the dog in the beginning of the game as well as to teach the dog tricks such as \"sit\" or \"roll over\". Players can bring their dogs on walks and to the park if they so choose. They may interact with other players in multi-player by using the DS's wireless linkup. It also uses the DS's internal clock and calendar to allow the dog to grow hungrier or dirtier based on the elapsed time. \n \nNintendogs received critical acclaim.

Equally startling is the deadly booby trap she triggers in the process of opening a locked door. She barely outruns the giant boulder bearing down on her, escaping the palace only to fall into a surging river, unconscious. The fairy Kukri, imprisoned for centuries in the chamber Anise inadvertently unlocked, rescues her and takes her to the Castle of Albyon. Anise awakens in the presence of the King, whose son is being held by demons in the very palace Anise narrowly escaped from. Recent events have unshakably convinced the King that this thief is descended from the Legendary Hero of Albyon, he who slew the Ancient Demon King centuries ago, and so he commands her thusly: free the Prince from the vile demons... or be tried and convicted as a thief and locked away for

Hamsterz Life is also known as Love ♥ Hamster or Love Love Hamster in Japan. \n \n \nGameplay[edit] \nHamsterz Life is from the Petz series from Ubisoft for the handheld systems. Being released after Petz 5, it is part of the second Petz series. Hamsterz Life lets you raise several breeds of hamsters and build fully customizable homes for them to live in. Just as in the other Petz games, players can interact with their hamsters by training, playing with, and feeding them. \n \nAt the start of the game, players can select their first hamster and name it. The hamster will then appear in a cage and be ready to play. Various actions can be chosen including training, feeding, care and other options. Training consists of teaching the hamster words (which they repeat back in their own hamster speak) by speaking the set phrases into the DS microphone. The hamster can repeat these phrases back, but inaudibly. Players can clean the cage and brush their hamsters. Hamsterz Life also includes many mini-games to play. Players can only have one hamster at home at once, any other hamsters that are owned are left with a girl with hamster ears until you wish to switch. Your hamsters can visit with the hamsters of friends who also own Hamsterz Life. When playing mini-games, if you win you receive prizes such as food or toys. You can also let your hamster out of its cage to play in the surrounding room. There are present boxes in the room, which contain prizes you receive when your hamster finds them.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hamsterz-life"},{"id":14718,"collection":{"id":935,"created_at":1399766400,"games":[6767,14716,14717,14718,18224,57012],"name":"Etrian Odyssey","slug":"etrian-odyssey","updated_at":1399766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/etrian-odyssey","checksum":"38697ba0-a1c8-79de-3980-303afffa5631"},"cover":{"id":13223,"game":14718,"height":577,"image_id":"e0kktltbqdjbseaj3hdm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e0kktltbqdjbseaj3hdm.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"a680f44f-0cb5-3364-59cb-9b4ee1b95d43"},"first_release_date":1270080000,"franchises":[{"id":737,"created_at":1448755200,"games":[6767,6768,8607,14709,14716,14717,14718,18224,27960,57012,70894],"name":"Etrian Odyssey","slug":"etrian-odyssey","updated_at":1448755200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/etrian-odyssey","checksum":"09f3e676-bca6-9179-5f7a-bd8210525305"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":28492,"company":{"id":818,"description":"Video game publisher ATLUS has established itself as one of its industry's most consistent, celebrated companies.

This will play out in three phases: investigation, where the player will discuss the case and clues with other characters; voting, where each member of the investigation team casts a vote on who they suspect is L or Kira based on the player's performance in the previous phase; L/Kira, where the player can either focus their investigation on one member to see if they are Kira (L part) or force a member off of the team (Kira part).","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/death-note-kira-game"},{"id":21211,"cover":{"id":18237,"game":21211,"height":481,"image_id":"volg09tqzfhpyj3n7mic","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/volg09tqzfhpyj3n7mic.jpg","width":544,"checksum":"108d761a-cd76-598e-edb2-b9ebee50e909"},"first_release_date":1251417600,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":40931,"company":{"id":1805,"name":"Noise","slug":"noise"}},{"id":40932,"company":{"id":6330,"logo":{"id":1449,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":294,"image_id":"ppsyr0o9mexuwrccjxod","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ppsyr0o9mexuwrccjxod.jpg","width":339,"checksum":"be097448-58b3-fbcd-9d4d-b1bcce46ce44"},"name":"Namco Bandai Games","slug":"namco-bandai-games"}}],"name":"Go!

NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

While the games feature several expansions in key areas, the overall plot follows the same direction as the original Gold and Silver. Some aspects exclusive to Crystal are also included. Like how FireRed and LeafGreen could link up with Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald to complete the Pokédex by trading regionally exclusive Pokémon, HeartGold and SoulSilver can link up with Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum to obtain Pokémon unavailable in Johto and Kanto (such as the Sinnoh starters) and vice versa. \nKris, despite being the female counterpart of Crystal's player character, is not included as the female player character, with a new character instead taking her place. Whether she is chosen to be the player character or not, this new character will still appear in the game. The unselected protagonist will take a pseudo-rival role similar to the unselected characters of Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum. \nThe games were released on September 12, 2009 in Japan, February 4, 2010 in Korea, March 14, 2010 in North America, March 25, 2010 in Australia and March 26, 2010 in Europe (this excludes the Netherlands, Luxembourg and parts of Belgium due to an in-game save error, with the patched copies later released on April 2, 2010).","total_rating":86.31305926031436,"total_rating_count":170,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-heartgold"},{"id":1519,"collection":{"id":314,"created_at":1349740800,"games":[1511,1512,1513,1514,1515,1516,1517,1518,1519,1520,1521,1522,1556,1557,1558,1559,1560,1561,2286,2287,6897,6898,8284,8353,8377,18099,18100,36792,36793,37382,115653,128071,128073,129586],"name":"Pokémon","slug":"pokemon","updated_at":1349740800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/pokemon","checksum":"540b63e5-1d4e-58ee-2b6b-a1ac3ba90ef0"},"cover":{"id":92658,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":1519,"height":800,"image_id":"co1zhu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1zhu.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"1db7a7c3-c26a-7a6d-158f-7bf1c23e7147"},"first_release_date":1221264000,"franchises":[{"id":60,"created_at":1372550400,"games":[1511,1512,1513,1514,1515,1516,1517,1518,1519,1520,1521,1522,1556,1557,1558,1559,1560,1561,1626,1627,1628,2286,2287,2288,2289,2290,2319,2320,2321,2322,2323,2324,2325,2642,2643,2724,2725,3574,4068,4069,4558,4559,4560,4561,4562,4563,4564,4565,4566,4567,6897,6898,7410,8284,8353,8377,8588,8589,8592,9564,10906,11720,12515,14606,14699,18099,18100,18138,18594,18704,20039,21700,24398,24423,24945,24949,24959,25027,25877,27052,32124,36570,36792,36793,36794,37382,43174,49857,52197,55011,55669,56053,57344,57382,59038,59116,60055,61007,61973,63048,63849,64033,64034,64282,66024,66027,66028,66029,66030,66031,66844,68380,68726,70506,72165,72248,73096,74809,74816,74818,76863,80213,81272,87797,91823,92306,102873,102874,103511,103512,103513,115653,115731,116246,118490,119156,127326,127982,128069,128071,128073,128307,129561,129585,129586,129587,129588,129809,129810,129822,129823,129825,129828,135142,135145,135164,135233,135381],"name":"Pokémon","slug":"pokemon","updated_at":1372550400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/pokemon","checksum":"ad5f9714-9f87-ee7b-919e-571fc848765f"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"},{"id":16,"created_at":1297641600,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","slug":"turn-based-strategy-tbs","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/turn-based-strategy-tbs","checksum":"af5d3ecd-2ebd-358b-70df-e9204b9761be"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":33948,"company":{"id":70,"description":"Nintendo Co., Ltd. is a multinational corporation located in Kyoto, Japan.

Marbles are rolling relentlessly down a twisted track toward you. Stop them by launching launch new marbles with your stylus. When three or more like-colored marbles match up, they vanish. Tons of power-ups, multiple tracks and a great multiplayer mode make Magnetica a must for puzzle/action fans. Innovative use of stylus to flick marbles.Ultrarealistic magnetic physics: Launched marbles will curve toward like-colored balls. Three single-player modes: Challenge, Quest and Puzzle. Multiple paths and scads of power-ups and hazards will keep you on your toes. Consult the all-in-one dashboard on your top screen. Show off your Magnetica personalty by battling a friend head-to-head. Single-player items boost your score, slow down or stop time, or reverse the course of the marbles. Versus weaponry includes Ion Clouds (smoke screens you'll have to blow away via the DS mic), Recoils (which block marbles), Black Holes (which suck up launched marbles), Viruses (which deflect marbles) and Gravitons (which alter the path of launched marbles).

with previous Professor Layton games, Unwound Future is an adventure game where the player solves puzzles offered by local citizens to progress the story forward, through dialogue and around 32 minutes of full motion video. The player moves about the game through still images of locations. The player can use the DS touchscreen to tap on non-player characters to start a dialog or to obtain a puzzle, and also can search anywhere on the background for hint coins, with some areas needing to be tapped several times to reveal a secret hint coin or puzzle. Puzzles are brainteasers of many varieties, including visual, math, and logic. There is no time limit to solve puzzles, and the player can get up to 3 hints at a cost of one hint coin each; a new feature in Unwound Future is a \"super hint\", costing 2 coins, that can only be bought after the other 3 hints have been revealed, but that nearly reveals the puzzle's solution. If the player is correct in solving the puzzle, they gain a number of \"Picarats\", a form of currency within the game.

It begins with four Slimes, Rocket, Hooly, Bo, and Swotsy, who are playing in front of the castle. Hooly has gotten his hands on a valuable flute, and in response to the flute being blown by Rocket, his father comes running over, forcing Hooly to stick the flute in Rocket's mouth. Afterward, an organization known as the Plob invades Boingburg, capturing 100 of its 101 inhabitants. Because he was distorted and long, the Plob mistakenly believed Rocket was not a Slime but a worm, and discarded him into Forewood Forest. There, Rocket begins his journey to rescue his fellow slimes, who have been locked up in large treasure chests.","total_rating":79.9997602531333,"total_rating_count":10,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-quest-heroes-rocket-slime"},{"id":1820,"collection":{"id":348,"created_at":1352592000,"games":[1812,1813,1814,1815,1816,1817,1818,1819,1820,1821,1822,1823,1824,1825,1826,11667,16584,16585,23913,89204,122266],"name":"Dragon Warrior","slug":"dragon-warrior","updated_at":1352592000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/dragon-warrior","checksum":"0c563895-3c59-099d-9bbe-e2a6a92c0624"},"cover":{"id":89769,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":1820,"height":1700,"image_id":"co1x9l","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1x9l.jpg","width":1277,"checksum":"fa53d84d-598c-a792-ed39-eb23991c5224"},"first_release_date":1247270400,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":20341,"company":{"id":837,"logo":{"id":2976,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":151,"image_id":"cl2ao","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cl2ao.jpg","width":326,"checksum":"0121b4c2-d437-ccbf-04a2-e056c80c0d65"},"name":"Level-5","slug":"level-5"}},{"id":20342,"company":{"id":26,"description":"Square Enix develops, publishes, distributes and licenses Square Enix, Eidos and Taito branded entertainment content in Europe and other PAL territories as part of the Square Enix group of companies.

There are optional button controls, but the main mode of control is to take two styli and tap on the touch screen, which shows the image of large Taiko drum. \n\nThe two main gamemodes are Free Play and Daily Dojo. Free Play is exactly as one would expect, and Daily Dojo is a once-a-day challenge on a random song you've unlocked. There are four difficulties: Flower, Bamboo, Tree, and Demon. Demon difficulty, also known as Oni Mode, is initially hidden and must be unlocked. In addition to the actual gameplay, you can also dress up your Taiko character in silly outfits. This does not affect actual gameplay and is only a visual change. There is also a multiplayer mode available. It can be played in single-cart mode, but if an opponent has a copy of the game the outfit they have dressed their Taiko in will appear on whatever character corresponds to which player they are.\n\nThe game comes with two \"Bachi Pens\", which are Taiko no Tatsujin-themed styli for use with the game, and is rated A on the CERO rating system (the Japanese equivalent of an E for Everyone on the ESRB rating system).","total_rating":79,"total_rating_count":6,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/taiko-no-tatsujin-ds-touch-de-dokodon"},{"id":36752,"cover":{"id":24400,"game":36752,"height":449,"image_id":"jp6szwqep68vrqwpu1gb","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jp6szwqep68vrqwpu1gb.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"a59bb27d-986d-0ced-3bba-7ddc14556626"},"first_release_date":1237420800,"franchises":[{"id":1029,"created_at":1496707200,"games":[36752],"name":"Black Butler","slug":"black-butler","updated_at":1496707200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/black-butler","checksum":"a4a0afde-794e-3305-9027-5b058ef90d59"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":49845,"company":{"id":26,"description":"Square Enix develops, publishes, distributes and licenses Square Enix, Eidos and Taito branded entertainment content in Europe and other PAL territories as part of the Square Enix group of companies.

Evil: Deadly Silence is an enhanced version of the original Resident Evil for the Nintendo DS port. It was made to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the series. Toshiaki Mori provided promotional artwork during the release of the game, including cover art.\n\nDeadly Silence includes a \"Classic Mode\", the original game with minimal enhancements and touch-screen support, and a \"Rebirth Mode\", containing a greater number of enemies and a series of new puzzles that make use of the platform's specifications.\n\nThe game makes use of the dual screen display with the top screen used to display the map, along with the player's remaining ammunition and health (determined by the color of the background); while the bottom screen displays the main action, and can be switched to show the player's inventory. The DS version also includes updated play mechanics: the 180-degree turn introduced in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, along with the knife button and tactical reload from Resident Evil 4. The updated controls are applicable to both Classic and Rebirth modes. Dialog and loading screens can now be skipped. The live-action footage was still censored, even in the game's Japanese release; however, the scene showing Kenneth's decapitated head was kept.\n\nIn \"Rebirth\", new puzzles are added that use the system's touch-screen. \"Knife Battle\" sequences, viewed from a first-person perspective, are also added, in which the player must fend off incoming enemies by swinging the knife via the stylus. One particular puzzle requires the player to resuscitate an injured comrade by blowing into the built-in microphone. The player can also shake off enemies by using the touch screen, performing a melee attack.\n\nThe game also includes wireless LAN support for up to four players with two different multiplayer game modes. The first is a cooperative mode in which each player must help each other solve puzzles and escape the mansion together. The other is a competitive mode in which the objective is to get the highest score out of all the players by destroying the most monsters, with the tougher monsters being worth more points. There are three playable multiplayer stages and nine playable characters.","total_rating":64.01921878636365,"total_rating_count":8,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-deadly-silence"},{"id":18856,"collection":{"id":1895,"created_at":1449273600,"games":[1864,14748,18856,27273,27275,119390,119394],"name":"Ni no Kuni","slug":"ni-no-kuni","updated_at":1449273600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/ni-no-kuni","checksum":"9a056559-a98c-f95c-85bf-ee65e9e4489e"},"cover":{"id":15198,"game":18856,"height":831,"image_id":"fyzvzudri5zeydq36sft","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fyzvzudri5zeydq36sft.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"9c260ffd-958a-06db-8ca6-ccaf32575007"},"first_release_date":1291852800,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":34823,"company":{"id":837,"logo":{"id":2976,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":151,"image_id":"cl2ao","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cl2ao.jpg","width":326,"checksum":"0121b4c2-d437-ccbf-04a2-e056c80c0d65"},"name":"Level-5","slug":"level-5"}}],"name":"Ni no Kuni: Dominion of the Dark Djinn","platforms":[20],"release_dates":[{"id":49965,"category":0,"created_at":1461196800,"date":1291852800,"game":18856,"human":"Dec 09, 2010","m":12,"platform":20,"region":5,"updated_at":1461196800,"y":2010,"checksum":"476b57d6-77ab-d09c-8d16-9648aab51ba0"}],"slug":"ni-no-kuni-dominion-of-the-dark-djinn","summary":"Ni no Kuni is a series of role-playing games developed by Level-5.

The objective of the source material is to reach the top of each level, taking out any enemies in the way by firing magical rainbows that can trap or eliminate foes as well as providing bridges for the player to walk on. Rainbows remain onscreen for a short amount of time but can be ?broken? by the player if they jump on them. Once broken, the rainbow will fall off the screen, taking out the first enemy it touches. The game also features a pleasing bonus item system where dispatched enemies leave behind items of food that have varying point values and power-ups that have a range of helpful effects. The major feature of this re-interpretation is shifting the entire game away from traditional controls by implementing a global touchscreen control system which radically alters the way in which the game plays. The game is also displayed across both screens of the DS. Rather than being fired by a button press, rainbows are now drawn directly onto the gameplay area using the stylus and movement is executed by dragging the player?s character around the levels.

There is a main path in the story mode that coincides with Toriyama's story for every character and some other paths played out as \"what if?\" scenarios, adding replayability to the game. Next to the story mode, there is the Z battle, the VS battle, Maximum, Free battle and Practice mode. The game has three difficulty levels. In team battles the player can tap the touchscreen to select another fighter. Touch can also be used to perform a powerful combined attack when it is available. \n \nThe sequel moves away from the level system of the first game, where reaching a new character level led to upgraded statistics, or new sprites and attacks.

Players need both puzzle-solving skills and creativity to earn a picture reward. \n\nEach puzzle has a sequence of numbers written in the margins of each column and each row. Those numbers show how many squares within that column or row need to be filled in. Players must deduce where each filled square is based on the numbers in the puzzle. Incorrect guesses earn the player a time penalty. If players solve the puzzle in under one hour, they earn a reward picture, an animated illustration of the thing represented in the puzzle. Puzzles range in size from simple 5x5 squares to much more challenging 15x15 squares—and larger. Players can create and swap puzzles with one another.","total_rating":70.1267730110282,"total_rating_count":7,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/picross-ds"},{"id":67798,"cover":{"id":111369,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":67798,"height":1052,"image_id":"co2dxl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dxl.jpg","width":789,"checksum":"2054780e-7b0a-dc19-414b-8f6a77d1eadf"},"first_release_date":1100995200,"name":"PictoChat","platforms":[20],"release_dates":[{"id":204857,"category":0,"created_at":1595462400,"date":1100995200,"game":67798,"human":"Nov 21, 2004","m":11,"platform":20,"region":2,"updated_at":1595462400,"y":2004,"checksum":"561a97e3-de38-b313-10ab-afa973b519b7"},{"id":204858,"category":0,"created_at":1595462400,"date":1101945600,"game":67798,"human":"Dec 02, 2004","m":12,"platform":20,"region":5,"updated_at":1595462400,"y":2004,"checksum":"f2451d12-84b4-d2e8-d0db-b14a6fe73356"},{"id":204859,"category":0,"created_at":1595462400,"date":1110499200,"game":67798,"human":"Mar 11, 2005","m":3,"platform":20,"region":1,"updated_at":1595462400,"y":2005,"checksum":"c6a2320f-c995-de71-31b2-4d93348b122c"},{"id":204860,"category":0,"created_at":1595462400,"date":1109203200,"game":67798,"human":"Feb 24, 2005","m":2,"platform":20,"region":3,"updated_at":1595462400,"y":2005,"checksum":"ecc55152-ac54-0d66-a8c2-e6ae1728aa83"}],"screenshots":[{"id":393719,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":67798,"height":432,"image_id":"sc8fsn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8fsn.jpg","width":272,"checksum":"f33e5e26-221c-eade-23fd-ca68f2b0bf16"},{"id":393720,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":67798,"height":427,"image_id":"sc8fso","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8fso.jpg","width":279,"checksum":"ab5b43fb-2e1e-fda6-fc49-3e4901f69510"}],"slug":"pictochat","summary":"PictoChat is a communication application built-in to all DS, DS Lite, and DSi hardware.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pictochat"},{"id":5987,"collection":{"id":689,"created_at":1390694400,"games":[4229,4230,4231,5987],"name":"Viewtiful Joe","slug":"viewtiful-joe","updated_at":1390694400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/viewtiful-joe","checksum":"9187e185-d983-44e2-4ee3-3516e09dffbe"},"cover":{"id":6175,"game":5987,"height":852,"image_id":"fbah0t4yltyfwpomucwv","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fbah0t4yltyfwpomucwv.jpg","width":948,"checksum":"1c5d6212-39f0-892d-88f9-08906a6715e1"},"first_release_date":1130889600,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":14392,"company":{"id":37,"description":"Capcom Co., Ltd. is a Japanese video game developer and publisher known for creating numerous multi-million selling game franchises, including Street Fighter, Mega Man, Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Ace Attorney, Monster Hunter, Dead Rising, Breath of Fire, as well as games based on the Disney animated properties.","logo":{"id":59,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":1024,"image_id":"hcbqwbhbmrabsfk600zs","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hcbqwbhbmrabsfk600zs.jpg","width":5592,"checksum":"349cabef-d8b4-460b-7402-8ec3a60c4e6d"},"name":"Capcom","slug":"capcom"}},{"id":14393,"company":{"id":2055,"description":"\"Clover Studio was an independent Japanese video game development studio funded by Capcom.

The studio focused largely on creating new intellectual property rather than sequels. When these failed to perform on par with Capcom's more popular series, Capcom attempted to merge the studio back into their internal R&amp;D.

The series is developed by Vicarious Visions and distributed by RedOctane and Activision. Three games in the series have been released since June 2008: Guitar Hero: On Tour, Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades and Guitar Hero On Tour: Modern Hits. \n \nAs with other games in the Guitar Hero series, the player is challenged to play through the lead or bass guitar portions of rock songs by matching colored notes that scroll on screen towards the player in time with physical actions to score points and keep the virtual crowd pleased. While the console versions of Guitar Hero use a separate guitar-shaped peripheral, Vicarious Visions developed a \"Guitar Grip\" unit that slips into the Game Boy Advance port on the DS or the DS Lite to be used with the games; the Grip is incompatible with the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo 3DS. The Guitar Grip provides a strap to hold the game unit while providing the player with four fret buttons; the player uses the fret buttons in combination with using the stylus to simulate strumming on the touch-sensitive screen of the DS. Each game features more than 25 songs, with some variation in track lists depending on the region of release, and multiple single-player modes. The local wi-fi capabilities of the DS are used for multiplayer mode, and allow a player to use songs from one installment of the series in competitive modes with a player with a different installment.","total_rating":61.75671352564655,"total_rating_count":14,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/guitar-hero-on-tour"},{"id":21679,"cover":{"id":23724,"game":21679,"height":450,"image_id":"kuvzcmbihzocqntfy8zi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kuvzcmbihzocqntfy8zi.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"a656503e-4002-c916-8e85-fcc45cb009fa"},"first_release_date":1206489600,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"name":"Brain Assist","platforms":[20],"release_dates":[{"id":92558,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":1206489600,"game":21679,"human":"Mar 26, 2008","m":3,"platform":20,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":2008,"checksum":"72fee90b-8b85-67b5-147b-831a4fb55bd6"}],"slug":"brain-assist","summary":"Are you tired and overworked?

The game's box art was created by artist Arthur Suydam, famous for his work on the Marvel Zombies line of comics. \n \nTouch the Dead is a rail shooter. Players use the stylus to point at oncoming zombies on the bottom screen. Pointing fires the weapon Steiner has equipped. Shots can be delivered to the head, arms, legs, and stomach. \n \nTo reload, players must simply grab a clip icon (located in the bottom right hand corner of the touch screen), and drag it to the bottom left hand corner which has an image of the 'magazine'. \n \nThe D-pad and face buttons of the console are simply used to switch weapons. Both serve the same purpose, and work for both right-handed and left-handed players. \n \nHealth and ammunition can be recovered by shooting crates and cabinets. The player also has the option of shooting switches to open doors and choose a left or right path when a fork appears. Either path chosen will still yield the same bonuses.","total_rating":64.5,"total_rating_count":6,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/touch-the-dead"},{"id":1526,"collection":{"id":315,"created_at":1349740800,"games":[1523,1524,1525,1526,1527],"name":"Trauma Center","slug":"trauma-center","updated_at":1349740800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/trauma-center","checksum":"acd4a9e1-6d8e-432f-eb10-b443e32685c3"},"cover":{"id":1479,"game":1526,"height":1382,"image_id":"jyrzlijnyefmuu5ilzmd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jyrzlijnyefmuu5ilzmd.jpg","width":1538,"checksum":"b3329062-e5a4-16f7-cd41-54384aa2e014"},"first_release_date":1214870400,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":61734,"company":{"id":818,"description":"Video game publisher ATLUS has established itself as one of its industry's most consistent, celebrated companies.

Along the way, Pac-Man will find power-ups like the Winged Chocolate, allowing him to fly through the worlds and jump over Ghosts, or the \"Knight Chocolate,\" providing him with armor which grants him the power to crash through walls and withstand more damage. Pac'N Roll also includes the original Pac-Man arcade game, allowing up to two players to munch on pellets and claim the highest score.","total_rating":75,"total_rating_count":6,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pac-n-roll"},{"id":21436,"collection":{"id":2286,"created_at":1469145600,"games":[20992,21385,21436],"name":"Nanostray","slug":"nanostray","updated_at":1469145600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/nanostray","checksum":"d4c9d139-e395-da1f-f504-c8986966cdd7"},"cover":{"id":26673,"game":21436,"height":1370,"image_id":"p3vl1ugq6c4jou7vnrp4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p3vl1ugq6c4jou7vnrp4.jpg","width":1532,"checksum":"445f1462-b79b-2f1d-33bb-a2807554b5bb"},"first_release_date":1120867200,"involved_companies":[{"id":39493,"company":{"id":10568,"name":"Shin'en Multimedia","slug":"shinen-multimedia"}},{"id":39494,"company":{"id":700,"logo":{"id":1281,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":88,"image_id":"m0ihgqz9vrksa4ye7duq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m0ihgqz9vrksa4ye7duq.jpg","width":231,"checksum":"9683c414-64c4-ec72-8646-dd0713bb98a1"},"name":"Majesco Entertainment","slug":"majesco-entertainment"}}],"name":"Nanostray","platforms":[20],"rating":73,"rating_count":3,"release_dates":[{"id":56771,"category":0,"created_at":1473897600,"date":1139529600,"game":21436,"human":"Feb 10, 2006","m":2,"platform":20,"region":1,"updated_at":1473897600,"y":2006,"checksum":"1a4aa8eb-77a1-9d99-3100-030c4da4866c"},{"id":141690,"category":0,"created_at":1517616000,"date":1150848000,"game":21436,"human":"Jun 21, 2006","m":6,"platform":20,"region":5,"updated_at":1517788800,"y":2006,"checksum":"735ca1ee-ee31-347e-1068-f0cc9ca8da6a"},{"id":141691,"category":0,"created_at":1517616000,"date":1120867200,"game":21436,"human":"Jul 09, 2005","m":7,"platform":20,"region":2,"updated_at":1517788800,"y":2005,"checksum":"4cb8644b-2b38-8f1d-9757-1b6c938e3503"}],"screenshots":[{"id":28827,"game":21436,"height":384,"image_id":"jk4alvc4lxxqyg2igsqy","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jk4alvc4lxxqyg2igsqy.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"30dabb12-ed20-5716-5be0-53bc935c33bc"},{"id":166861,"game":21436,"height":480,"image_id":"mnx3shjrvbfgrv9qo2oa","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mnx3shjrvbfgrv9qo2oa.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"974d7b57-7643-0566-2244-4e2fe1639645"},{"id":166862,"game":21436,"height":480,"image_id":"voujol6h0bhezcira8nk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/voujol6h0bhezcira8nk.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"68885c6f-00cd-aa5f-82c5-adfc5e89ce8e"},{"id":166863,"game":21436,"height":480,"image_id":"rlkjwomxa68ihxe8skgm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rlkjwomxa68ihxe8skgm.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"a9c0f7a8-0674-07b6-e43f-87e73aeefefa"},{"id":166864,"game":21436,"height":480,"image_id":"s9auirjfodxfxat4b7ym","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s9auirjfodxfxat4b7ym.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"0cb53aaa-6c38-153a-5c63-91e0fb2a7ead"}],"slug":"nanostray","summary":"Nanostray is a vertical scrolling shooter video game for the Nintendo DS.
