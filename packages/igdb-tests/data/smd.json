The Coyote has a special leap attack which allows him to make a last ditch attempt to grab the bird!","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/desert-demolition-starring-road-runner-and-wile-e-coyote"},{"id":45619,"first_release_date":746668800,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Kishi Densetsu","platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"id":98802,"category":0,"created_at":1500422400,"date":746668800,"game":45619,"human":"Aug 30, 1993","m":8,"platform":29,"region":8,"updated_at":1500422400,"y":1993,"checksum":"ac087ca8-6cde-8bb4-bfa8-8a37b2c3b33a"}],"slug":"kishi-densetsu","summary":"Kishi Densetsu (騎士伝説) is a 1993 war simulation game for the Sega Mega Drive by Kodansha Research Institute released exclusively in Japan.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kishi-densetsu"},{"id":4536,"cover":{"id":8035,"game":4536,"height":2100,"image_id":"banndfqkrfdj8lgzdocw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/banndfqkrfdj8lgzdocw.jpg","width":1535,"checksum":"b5c72106-74b9-236e-98e7-e594eda68a01"},"first_release_date":683424000,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":36066,"company":{"id":229,"logo":{"id":3373,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":400,"image_id":"cl2lp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cl2lp.jpg","width":1200,"checksum":"93df4847-8b3a-d83c-21d2-f55934765d0e"},"name":"SEGA of America","slug":"sega-of-america"}},{"id":36067,"company":{"id":4981,"description":"Sega Enterprises was the corporate name of Sega of Japan from the early 1960's to July of 2000.","logo":{"id":3404,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":156,"image_id":"cl2mk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cl2mk.jpg","width":469,"checksum":"9f47e482-8d49-62ff-28ea-de15d2c6d865"},"name":"Sega Enterprises","slug":"sega-enterprises"}}],"name":"Jewel Master","platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"id":51699,"category":0,"created_at":1465603200,"date":683510400,"game":4536,"human":"Aug 30, 1991","m":8,"platform":29,"region":5,"updated_at":1465689600,"y":1991,"checksum":"f606364d-0cf3-5168-6ea2-8b442acc3dd6"},{"id":51700,"category":2,"created_at":1465603200,"date":694137600,"game":4536,"human":"1991","m":12,"platform":29,"region":1,"updated_at":1465689600,"y":1991,"checksum":"d27999a4-32d7-587b-3b52-785dd419828f"},{"id":51701,"category":0,"created_at":1465603200,"date":683424000,"game":4536,"human":"Aug 29, 1991","m":8,"platform":29,"region":2,"updated_at":1465689600,"y":1991,"checksum":"09a03841-fa02-0c59-8031-66280292a08d"}],"slug":"jewel-master","summary":"An army of demons terrorizes the land.

After choosing a location he / she can pick the players for both teams. Most slots on the select are reserved for custom players. If there's no player on the slot, a player called PLAY H will appear as placeholder. Each Location has a few special players, which can be just selected there. Also, after pressing the select changes and gives the player the possibility to choose a profi character. A Tournament works similar to Pick Up. The differences are that you just can choose players for your team and can't pick profi players. After selection a overview with the different matches will be shown. The goal is to survive the tournament and beat all rival teams.Slam features a Editor in which you can create your own players. On the first screen you can name your character and change his look. Similar to RPGs you can give 90 points to different abilities, which have influence on how the player will behave in-game. Finally you can choose a hometown for your character to complete it. In case you don't like the default slam, you can give every custom player own. On the first screen you can select which ranges slam you want to edit and test it. If the selected player can't jump high (has an UPS value of 11 and lower), he can just dunk in range 1, otherwise in 2 also.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/slam-shaq-vs-the-legends"},{"id":45530,"first_release_date":760060800,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"name":"Fukkokuban - Phantasy Star I","platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"id":98867,"category":0,"created_at":1500422400,"date":760060800,"game":45530,"human":"Feb 01, 1994","m":2,"platform":29,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1994,"checksum":"de310058-90c1-6db0-baea-ab935771cc2d"}],"slug":"fukkokuban-phantasy-star-i","summary":"This is a special edition of the first Phantasy Star for Mega Drive.

The game was originally published by Toaplan in Japan, and later by Seismic in North America. It is part of the Aleste series of shooter video games. The game has been re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan, North America, and European regions. \n \nThe gameplay involves obtaining power-ups called P-chips. The power-ups cause the main mecha to change color and grant sub-weapons. The sub-weapon also acts as a shield; if the mecha has a sub-weapon and is hit by an enemy attack, the sub weapon is destroyed in place of the mecha. The sub-weapons can be upgraded up to four times if the player obtains the same powerup more than once. The sub-weapons include an energy shield, a beam cannon, and missiles. The player can also obtain and stockpile helper drones, which have customisable attack modes. Up to two drones can assist the player in combat; when one is destroyed, a new one appears if the player has any in reserve. \n \nIn an alternate Tenryaku Era in the year 91 (2290 AD in the American version), technological advancements in Japan suddenly explode making robotics, computers and space travel possible. A space colony project is planned, but the environmental control system to a space colony known as \"Little Japan\" goes out of control and the supercomputer controlling the colony, Dire51, goes rogue, sending its attack units against mankind. Leading the attacks is a black transforming attack robot called Big Asia (大亜) responsible for most of the attacks. A defense squad of mech pilots is called in for a counter-attack, but only one pilot, Ellinor (Terri in the American release), survived and continues the fight.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/musha-aleste-fullmetal-fighter-ellinor"},{"id":45689,"cover":{"id":28158,"game":45689,"height":3119,"image_id":"nd5nfxemzex99exwq2io","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nd5nfxemzex99exwq2io.jpg","width":2235,"checksum":"2c2f1362-4dfb-fb5a-dece-139c0672374e"},"first_release_date":649468800,"name":"Assault Suits Leynoss","platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"id":98653,"category":0,"created_at":1500422400,"date":649468800,"game":45689,"human":"Aug 01, 1990","m":8,"platform":29,"region":8,"updated_at":1500422400,"y":1990,"checksum":"bbd23115-e4fc-afae-9894-96e93d6f1981"}],"screenshots":[{"id":112469,"game":45689,"height":933,"image_id":"qjsvfazrbjxti2wbxq2i","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qjsvfazrbjxti2wbxq2i.jpg","width":1333,"checksum":"db53f9e3-4ae8-5d09-3063-7a6c932d51bf"},{"id":112470,"game":45689,"height":933,"image_id":"wlaozlrhoa9iwijeuvw7","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wlaozlrhoa9iwijeuvw7.jpg","width":1333,"checksum":"42f4ac40-fbf2-d526-6e15-23c43d32a673"},{"id":112471,"game":45689,"height":933,"image_id":"bmsafkgpichcuaqzousb","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bmsafkgpichcuaqzousb.jpg","width":1333,"checksum":"b4546d47-a7a6-accf-4d32-57abeb1a6688"},{"id":112472,"game":45689,"height":933,"image_id":"lq6nyn5xhuupacummwjm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lq6nyn5xhuupacummwjm.jpg","width":1333,"checksum":"55d046ae-90d8-b835-1e06-b9348d3f1e89"}],"slug":"assault-suits-leynoss","summary":"Target Earth is a space shooting game set in the future with Earth under attack by robots.

Fortunately, the Sonic Heroes are never at rest, and once again wage their battle to defeat Eggman's evil forces. \n \nHowever, the heroes have landed in double jeopardy. Eggman's madman descendant, Eggman Nega, has escaped from the Ifrit's dimension, and is wreaking his usual havoc in an effort to destroy the world. He's even captured Eggman's top three lieutenants, the ruthless Team Metallix, and reprogrammed them to do his even more evil bidding. \n \nUnlike previous instances of Nega's destruction, Eggman is not fazed. He figures that once he's in control of the world, he can take care of Eggman Nega as he pleases. Unfortunately for Eggman, Sonic the Hedgehog isn't having that. Before he can decide who to dispatch where, he receives a call through the communicator Tails gave him. The message: someone's already on the case. Not just someone, but someones! \n \nApparently, Sonic's very own sister, Sonia the Hedgehog has already caught wind of Nega's evil and is out to stop him. Sonic is a bit eased, knowing full well of his sister's strength and agility. She also lets him know that she has found and teamed up with a mysterious young hedgehog who can move things with his mind. Sonic instantly recognizes that Sonia is with his newest ally: Silver the Hedgehog. Silver has once again traveled through time to ensure that the future is free of Nega's tampering (though he really ought to just stay here in the present, you know). Knowing that the two hedgehogs are more than capable of handling the situation, Sonic leaves it to them, and resumes dealing with Eggman. \n \nEggman Nega is well aware that Sonic is busy with his dimwitted ancestor.

Now being a fan of Telenet you’d think I’d side with Battle Monsters being the better monster battler. Sadly not. Telenet’s Riot team have produced one hell of a steaming pile of crap. In fact you can tell right away that this game is going to be a dud as soon as you pass the title screen. No options or decent game modes to choose from. Basically you get Player VS CPU or Player VS Player. That’s it. \n \nIn game graphics are average at best although there is quite a bit of sprite flicker at times when two beasts line up against each other. Not really acceptable in a game when you only have 2 moving characters on screen. Mind you, the audio is far worse than the graphics. Awful tunes with what I think are a few grunts from the beasts. The samples are that low in quality that I can hardly tell. \n \nBut wait, maybe this game looks and sounds so bad because it plays so well? Afraid not. Beast Warriors plays just how it looks and sounds, awful. The controls are ropey, collision detection is a mystery at times and the AI of the CPU seems to pull off moves that just wouldn’t be possible. There’s no question about it. The best aspect of Beast Warriors is the cover art which to be fair is very nice. If you’re the kind of person who buys games for their cover art then I’d say this would be on top of your shopping list but for the rest of us this game should be flushed down the toilet with the rest of the shit.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/beast-warrior"},{"id":45604,"first_release_date":691545600,"name":"Shougi no Hoshi","platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"id":98813,"category":0,"created_at":1500422400,"date":691545600,"game":45604,"human":"Dec 01, 1991","m":12,"platform":29,"region":8,"updated_at":1500422400,"y":1991,"checksum":"154ba35d-60d8-a0b8-0c0f-0accfcc2fbb8"}],"slug":"shougi-no-hoshi","summary":"Shougi no Hoshi (将棋の星) is a 1991 game for the Sega Mega Drive by Home Data.

You can get extra items by interacting with various objects and characters, pressing the action button.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/crystals-pony-tale"},{"id":4397,"cover":{"id":6108,"game":4397,"height":700,"image_id":"sxqdj95c4ikgpf9v2gra","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sxqdj95c4ikgpf9v2gra.jpg","width":493,"checksum":"b8292636-7a05-7284-339e-6c6632553477"},"first_release_date":689299200,"name":"Taiheiki","platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"id":10141,"category":0,"created_at":1390694400,"date":689299200,"game":4397,"human":"Nov 05, 1991","m":11,"platform":29,"region":8,"updated_at":1390694400,"y":1991,"checksum":"238f47bf-730d-3335-1421-b78a1666a15e"}],"slug":"taiheiki","summary":"Taiheiki is a strategy game that was released for the Turbografx CD.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/taiheiki"},{"id":46203,"collection":{"id":785,"created_at":1392076800,"games":[5332,17962,18022,23379,46203,48090,51539,62324,86223],"name":"R.B.I.

A time where the blending of technology and human flesh is common; it is around the time the Matrix, a huge computer network, came online, with the ability to jack into its cyberspace directly. It was also a time of magic renewal: a phenomenon known as The Awakening occurred, where magic returned into the world. Sorcery was once again possible, and slowly and seemingly at random humans began to mutate into orcs, dwarves, elves or trolls.

He's clever! He's one good lookin' opossum. It's Sparkster the Rocket Knight, the heroic jet pack jockey with warp speed, quick wits and pumped up personality. After all, who else do you know can get a grip with his tail? Rocket through 7 epic stages of animalistic adventure, home of the hugest, strangest enemy pig creatures imaginable. (In fact, your mission is crammed with more ham than a Hollywood premier.) Destroy the Emperor who's on a porcine power trip that will take him to the Key to the Pig Star. In every stage you'll be moving, flying and riding in a new direction to escape opossum punishment. You're the thrust-meister controlling Sparkster's jet pack and his assault sword. Confront mechanized menaces like the Giant Pigbot, the Drill Of A Lifetime, and the snappy Crab Rangoon.

The game's pace has been significantly altered within the difficulty and the length of the stages. Uncommon to most shooter games, Daiginjō uses both vertical and horizontal scrolling for its stages.

Extends are awarded and there are no checkpoints, but if a player loses all their lives and continues, they have to restart the level over again.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/whip-rush"},{"id":134348,"collection":{"id":6272,"created_at":1591056000,"games":[28267,134347,134348,134349],"name":"Wisdom Tree Collection","slug":"wisdom-tree-collection","updated_at":1591056000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/wisdom-tree-collection","checksum":"49b9479d-1620-4cea-4423-15096a4aed56"},"cover":{"id":104344,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":134348,"height":504,"image_id":"co28ig","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co28ig.jpg","width":368,"checksum":"e86a0074-9b80-800c-7ea8-244c4733ba2f"},"first_release_date":1485734400,"franchises":[{"id":1941,"created_at":1591056000,"games":[11164,28267,134347,134348,134349],"name":"Wisdom Tree","slug":"wisdom-tree","updated_at":1591056000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/wisdom-tree","checksum":"1ef8ecd8-a023-f849-a882-274a1a1f5ad9"}],"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":100562,"company":{"id":5909,"description":"Wisdom Tree is a Christian gaming company originally called Color Dreams.

Through the mech, the player purchases surface combat units, airlifts them across the battlefield, and issues them orders. These command activities can only be performed through the mech. Vehicles follow their assigned orders (which are fairly basic: patrol, garrison, capture base) until they either run out of fuel or are destroyed.

The events are: \n \nKayak: The player goes on a downhill stream, and must navigate through gates without missing or touching them (unlike the real event, there are no reverse gates), as well as avoiding to hit the margins of the stream. Pushing forward paddles, pressing a direction along a button allows a sharper turn. The winner is the one with the fastest time after penalty time is added \nArchery: Each competitor has four targets, each with three arrows. By moving the directional buttons the player moves the erratic crosshair, while pressing a button fires the arrow. \n \n400m Hurdles: The player does a full lap on the track by pressing the first button to set the pace and the second to jump. Mistiming the jump either makes the athlete knock the hurdle and lose a few tenths of second, or goes completely off-balance and falls, ending the event. \n \nHigh Jump and Pole Vault: Two similar events where the player starts by setting the bar height, and then mashing the power button to build enough speed. Then, just before the jump point the action button must be pressed and held until the athlete is in position to pass over the bar. The contest ends once there are three misses at an height, or the maximum height is cleared. \nEquestrian: The most technical event, the player must steer the horse to the best trajectory while jumping over hurdles and walls. While a knockdown means a time penalty in the end, if the horse refuses to do a jump (if the button is pressed too soon or too late) the competition ends immediately. \n \nJavelin: A simple event where each player has three attempts to launch the javelin as far as possible. To do so, first some speed must be built, and a few steps before the mark start pressing the action button to start the launch sequence, which initiates the angle measure. Once the player releases the button (ideally at an angle between 40 and 45 degrees next to the mark), the javelin is released as well \nCycling: In this sprint event the player must complete a number of laps in the velodrome, while keeping as fast and as close as possible to the inner edge without falling. \n \nLike with Winter Challenge, graphically, the game features the same polygonal environments with bitmap athletes and game modes include the ability to train or compete in a tournament (up to ten human players, with three computer levels and 16 nations to choose from). It's also possible to replay and even store your best (or worst) moments.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-games-summer-challenge"},{"id":130091,"cover":{"id":93103,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":130091,"height":533,"image_id":"co1zu7","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1zu7.jpg","width":794,"checksum":"2fa7a175-5ad0-d06f-6b3e-f8ee7c32c39f"},"first_release_date":1559001600,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":93409,"company":{"id":24374,"name":"RetroSouls","slug":"retrosouls"}}],"name":"Misplaced","platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"id":189303,"category":0,"created_at":1582243200,"date":1559001600,"game":130091,"human":"May 28, 2019","m":5,"platform":29,"region":8,"updated_at":1582243200,"y":2019,"checksum":"230d2e92-1692-d9cf-4999-75f5718669fe"}],"slug":"misplaced","summary":"My name is Hara... \n \nEvery day I start in the same way, I wake up on a small strange island that hovers somewhere in the clouds.

There are two jumps available, the ball jump suitable for height and the hurdle jump, suitable for distance. Both allow Izzy to clear an enemy, but the second harms him.If Izzy is hit, then he must find three medals, or at the next hit he loses a life. There are some extra objects, like Olympic torches, and eggs that hatch either objects for bonus points, trampolines or morph points to reach otherwise inaccessible areas or traps. Izzy can also morph into a glider, a baseball player, an archer or a rocket, among others, to overcome some sections of the levels. \n \nGraphics and sound remain faithful to the cartoony origins of the mascot.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/izzy-s-quest-for-the-olympic-rings"},{"id":4382,"collection":{"id":3874,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[4382,6695,6696,12082,37629,42530,42532,43525,45607,46357,46552,48517,60531,60559,79148,79723,79724,79844,80312,80401],"name":"YuYu Hakusho","slug":"yuyu-hakusho","updated_at":1507766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/yuyu-hakusho","checksum":"dace731f-0056-be80-1912-3a07ea457f58"},"cover":{"id":7883,"game":4382,"height":2100,"image_id":"kud3jhuk0uxsobad4w9g","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kud3jhuk0uxsobad4w9g.jpg","width":1528,"checksum":"fb706444-0ecd-e2a5-74ca-6a370fadac96"},"first_release_date":788832000,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Yū Yū Hakusho Gaiden","platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"id":10126,"category":2,"created_at":1390694400,"date":788832000,"game":4382,"human":"1994","m":12,"platform":29,"region":8,"updated_at":1390694400,"y":1994,"checksum":"bcf744ea-6917-d1d6-b969-58b60ed6a8e7"}],"slug":"yu-yu-hakusho-gaiden","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/yu-yu-hakusho-gaiden"},{"id":46253,"collection":{"id":3873,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[27060,46253,46254,104819,116643,116645,116646,116647],"name":"Mutant League Sports","slug":"mutant-league-sports","updated_at":1507766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/mutant-league-sports","checksum":"abe8b424-be58-cf84-d542-0994bc6b068b"},"cover":{"id":53258,"game":46253,"height":360,"image_id":"jlmpcsc8snv5m80fqstc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jlmpcsc8snv5m80fqstc.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"4abdf3d1-d906-32ca-d5d7-15bab4998cfd"},"first_release_date":788832000,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":102815,"company":{"id":1,"description":"Electronic Arts Inc. is a leading global interactive entertainment software company.

Better items can only be acquired by winning money in tournaments.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tnn-outdoors-bass-tournament-96"},{"id":8124,"collection":{"id":1082,"created_at":1415232000,"games":[8122,8123,8124,8125],"name":"Illusion","slug":"illusion","updated_at":1415232000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/illusion","checksum":"900db226-370d-7597-4829-1d800174fe9a"},"cover":{"id":8571,"game":8124,"height":356,"image_id":"mnrng9h6ebymdbdnfkna","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mnrng9h6ebymdbdnfkna.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"050b2843-5a60-efbb-3b4e-9f4bf4b52216"},"first_release_date":724550400,"franchises":[{"id":26,"created_at":1341100800,"games":[540,542,1166,1509,1510,2473,2926,2933,3254,3467,3849,3880,3881,3882,3883,3886,3887,4747,4806,4807,4809,4811,4812,5212,5218,5240,5241,6487,6756,6765,7220,7356,7654,8118,8122,8123,8124,8125,8126,8127,8128,8129,8130,11083,11495,11963,12122,12910,12921,13379,17753,17818,19097,19212,19248,19900,20627,21086,23792,24952,25912,27791,30977,30979,36228,36312,42489,43375,43737,44013,44025,44065,44764,45043,45780,46431,46434,46673,47788,47789,47790,47822,47844,48992,49153,49190,49202,49261,49282,49404,49405,49406,49407,49410,49411,49478,49919,49922,49942,50016,50099,50307,50426,50478,50681,50687,51281,51375,55072,57214,57622,57919,57920,57923,58005,59938,59939,60243,60692,61960,62415,63272,63748,65583,65604,66270,66851,66982,68939,69051,69056,69885,70247,70308,70964,71630,71876,71987,72032,72123,72885,73439,73453,74101,74108,74426,77330,78216,78286,78482,78483,78484,78590,78641,79718,79813,79840,79914,79954,81206,81487,83509,83783,85089,86045,89817,91476,92058,96138,97983,98009,98240,98278,98558,108251,109480,113889,115332,116973,120809,122082,122508,122534,123397,123599,124644,127640,127641,132096],"name":"Disney","slug":"disney","updated_at":1341100800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/disney","checksum":"b3e2eec4-c136-0d9a-7428-a10cc07d6789"},{"id":35,"created_at":1349654400,"games":[1509,1510,3408,3773,3885,5404,6379,6381,6765,8122,8123,8124,8125,8126,8127,8128,11495,66270],"name":"Mickey Mouse","slug":"mickey-mouse","updated_at":1349654400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/mickey-mouse","checksum":"529c049d-f053-8e71-7e58-c46fa5020e5c"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":19347,"company":{"id":112,"description":"As one of the leading interactive entertainment companies, SEGA cultivates creative talent worldwide with offices in America, Japan and our European HQ in London.

His only reminder of the incident is S.O.P.H.I.A., the vehicle he used to stop them, which he has hidden in an abandoned barn. One day, one bolt of lightning struck the house and caused the ceiling to crumble, knocking Jason unconscious. When Jason woke up, S.O.P.H.I.A. was in pieces and the parts he had collected from his first dealings with the Mutant Bosses were missing. Little does Jason know that there are more lightning beings where the first one came from and they are planning to destroy the Earth. The beings started digging towards the Earth's core in order to shift the planet's weight off its axis, leading to total annihilation. The parts from S.O.P.H.I.A. are being used to create a robotic army to assist the being in accomplishing their mission. Now, Jason must stop them, but he won't make it without the help of S.O.P.H.I.A. Since he can't recover the parts, he decided to redesign it to better prepare himself for the ordeal facing him. After 29 days, S.O.P.H.I.A. was completely rebuilt and ready for battle. Remembering where he saw the being's footsteps, Jason jumped in his vehicle and headed towards the mountains where the challenge begins.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/blaster-master-2"},{"id":20593,"cover":{"id":53849,"game":20593,"height":407,"image_id":"sidotwjxyqidphoewugg","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sidotwjxyqidphoewugg.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"dd093398-04ff-9102-5641-95c9b4cfb805"},"first_release_date":760060800,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Mario Andretti Racing","platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"id":98505,"category":0,"created_at":1500422400,"date":760060800,"game":20593,"human":"Feb 01, 1994","m":2,"platform":29,"region":8,"updated_at":1500422400,"y":1994,"checksum":"0d7e4e0f-572f-7d3b-ac05-3ad687646747"}],"slug":"mario-andretti-racing","summary":"Italian-born Mario Andretti is one of the most successful racing drivers in the US scene, and five of his relatives have also raced professionally.

The game consists of six stages, with the first two stages and the final one covering events from the film, whereas Stage 3 to 5 are set before the events of the film and adapts key episodes from the TV show's second season (namely \"White Light\", \"Ninja Encounter\", and \"Power Transfer\"). The game's soundtrack, composed by Hikoshi Hashimoto, features hard rock arrangements of Ron Wasserman's original TV themes. \n \nThe game contains a total of nine rangers: Tommy, Adam, Kimberly, Billy, Aisha, Rocky, Zach, Trini, and Jason. When selecting Jason, Zach, and Trini, the voice clips of Adam, Aisha, and Rocky are heard when calling out their respective Zord name as their morphing command. The reason for this is because the original actors for them were released from contract after the events of the Power Transfer two-parter episode of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. Sega and Banpresto asked for permission from Saban Entertainment to use their characters but have the three replacements use their voices instead of Jason, Trini, and Zach. There are cinematic scenes in digitized form that are abridged from the movie and some from Season 2 of the show. Lord Zedd, Goldar, the Putty Patrol, and Oozemen appear as sub-enemies. Nimrod the Scarlet Sentinel, AC, and DC are renamed in this title as Sentinel Neck, Sentinel Ear, and Sentinel Ring respectively. Players also can fight the Ecto-Morphicons using Ninja Megazord or Falcon Zord (both by 2-Player mode; Thunder Megazord and Mega Tigerzord against the Sentinels).

All three types of players have the same basic abilities and vary only on their personal strengths. In many cases, human players are better than their robot counterparts. One major difference between the human and robot characters is that the robot characters can blow up (or lose all their power) if they are worked too hard during a game. That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, you can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out. When they are tired, they will pant heavily and throw the ball very slowly. This can be remedied by either an upgrade or, as in real baseball, switching to a relief pitcher.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-baseball-2020"},{"id":45781,"collection":{"id":4867,"created_at":1512777600,"games":[4285,12714,33042,43734,45781,69971,71139],"name":"PGA Tour Golf","slug":"pga-tour-golf","updated_at":1512777600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/pga-tour-golf","checksum":"ec24208a-3cf6-f7ce-4037-9feb934181eb"},"cover":{"id":52191,"game":45781,"height":318,"image_id":"yfejy1hbr67q29er4k61","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yfejy1hbr67q29er4k61.jpg","width":223,"checksum":"416798f7-d334-7c1f-2c95-1190ddbc4df8"},"first_release_date":760060800,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"PGA Tour Golf III","platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"id":98516,"category":0,"created_at":1500422400,"date":760060800,"game":45781,"human":"Feb 01, 1994","m":2,"platform":29,"region":8,"updated_at":1500422400,"y":1994,"checksum":"9b87ec93-1fcc-dd23-5058-ea3ba34d0bde"}],"slug":"pga-tour-golf-iii","summary":"The team at Polygames make some small improvements to the latest PGA title.

Ten years later, a mysterious invasion force led by an evil sorceress attacked her village and kidnapped Magh, prompting Dahna on her first battle.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dahna-megami-tanjou"},{"id":93008,"cover":{"id":110367,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":93008,"height":1362,"image_id":"co2d5r","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2d5r.jpg","width":1021,"checksum":"1e7f6c31-965a-4d65-d6e9-d7328434fe9c"},"first_release_date":1009756800,"franchises":[{"id":1529,"created_at":1568160000,"games":[45764,93008,122331,122333,122362,122616],"name":"Show do Milhão","slug":"show-do-milhao","updated_at":1568160000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/show-do-milhao","checksum":"34bb8316-594c-7fab-cdfd-63eb78e1ffab"}],"genres":[{"id":26,"created_at":1301961600,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","slug":"quiz-trivia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/quiz-trivia","checksum":"256a99dd-dd06-bc0c-d53b-dc3098da4d49"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":84242,"company":{"id":3690,"name":"Tectoy","slug":"tectoy"}}],"name":"Show do Milhão","platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"id":175460,"category":2,"created_at":1568073600,"date":1009756800,"game":93008,"human":"2001","m":12,"platform":29,"region":8,"updated_at":1568073600,"y":2001,"checksum":"4a503492-7ddd-aba3-07c6-7bb5d9ddc7fa"}],"screenshots":[{"id":332896,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":93008,"height":224,"image_id":"sc74v4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc74v4.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"59e42a36-162d-bea6-763a-747ed3d7fea0"},{"id":332897,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":93008,"height":224,"image_id":"sc74v5","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc74v5.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"d41d6784-b283-b8fc-b432-c5b7196e05e6"},{"id":332898,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":93008,"height":224,"image_id":"sc74v6","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc74v6.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"c4970da4-94b2-a0c1-12c8-6d565a4069e7"},{"id":332899,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":93008,"height":224,"image_id":"sc74v7","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc74v7.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"65f883e4-4acf-bf47-23fb-dfc2dfaeadff"}],"slug":"show-do-milhao","summary":"Show do Milhão is a Sega Mega Drive game based on a Brazilian TV show with the same name.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/show-do-milhao"},{"id":27798,"cover":{"id":21158,"game":27798,"height":504,"image_id":"lr7rfoe7w0j7yw38hrpo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lr7rfoe7w0j7yw38hrpo.jpg","width":359,"checksum":"c27a2afa-2d6c-5ca1-c1a2-bd1295082b18"},"first_release_date":673920000,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"},{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":45216,"company":{"id":2064,"name":"Data East USA","slug":"data-east-usa"}}],"name":"Two Crude Dudes","platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"id":66741,"category":0,"created_at":1489708800,"date":673920000,"game":27798,"human":"May 11, 1991","m":5,"platform":29,"region":8,"updated_at":1489708800,"y":1991,"checksum":"9b8659f8-2eb7-8da6-eeb1-32535789c688"}],"screenshots":[{"id":38107,"game":27798,"height":480,"image_id":"nxafyjiq2k3roth8d7on","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nxafyjiq2k3roth8d7on.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"7be43c27-5df3-20a8-e911-1304a0bb492f"},{"id":38108,"game":27798,"height":480,"image_id":"r67eeywgs2jcg0krxafv","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/r67eeywgs2jcg0krxafv.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"84d2e41a-3bd8-f87d-2779-18a8e5893a9c"}],"slug":"two-crude-dudes","summary":"Two Crude Dudes is a 1991 beat 'em up arcade game produced by Data East.
