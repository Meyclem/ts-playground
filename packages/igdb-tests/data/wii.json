Naruto's transformation now has three tails. Another new feature is the Senzai Ninriki (translated in Clash of Ninja Revolution 3 as Latent Ninja Powers), where every character glows a certain colour when they hit low health/crisis mode. Similar to gaining new specials in crisis mode as of the first Revolution game and beforehand Naruto: Gekitō Ninja Taisen! 3, the Senzai Ninriki is a special crisis mode that provides certain effects depending on the character, for example Naruto and Temari's backward strong attacks no longer use up chakra, Hinata can chakra cancel her attacks with no chakra cost, Kakashi deals damage through guard with all his attacks, Neji and Gaara automatically deflect projectiles while standing still, certain characters' moves become unblockable and so on. Most of the characters' Senzai Ninriki effects change in Naruto Shippūden: Clash of Ninja Revolution 3 onwards. \nOne of the game's new modes is the \"Hurricane Clash Mode\", which is also reworked into the new story mode which is original from the main storyline. In this mode, the player controls their character in a full 3D movement perspective and can take on hordes of ninja in a beat em' up genre fashion, with many character movesets retweaked solely for this mode. This style has not appeared in any later Gekitou Ninja Taisen/Clash of Ninja games ever since. \nThis game was released only in Japan.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/naruto-shippuden-gekitou-ninja-taisen-ex3"},{"id":86372,"cover":{"id":62703,"game":86372,"height":1408,"image_id":"iwwzwy2k6w8j706xtogy","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iwwzwy2k6w8j706xtogy.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"77a03172-cbe8-9277-d67b-9494202877a0"},"first_release_date":1193097600,"name":"Table Tennis","platforms":[5],"release_dates":[{"id":145984,"category":0,"created_at":1517788800,"date":1193097600,"game":86372,"human":"Oct 23, 2007","m":10,"platform":5,"region":2,"updated_at":1517788800,"y":2007,"checksum":"645e211a-af7d-051c-1306-458d49d7e75e"},{"id":145985,"category":0,"created_at":1517788800,"date":1193356800,"game":86372,"human":"Oct 26, 2007","m":10,"platform":5,"region":1,"updated_at":1517788800,"y":2007,"checksum":"e0c0337e-ce00-d705-77a9-ea38a0609ead"},{"id":145986,"category":0,"created_at":1517788800,"date":1193097600,"game":86372,"human":"Oct 23, 2007","m":10,"platform":5,"region":5,"updated_at":1517788800,"y":2007,"checksum":"d8881c21-243c-91fc-3ecf-9812552fa4ae"}],"screenshots":[{"id":181830,"game":86372,"height":480,"image_id":"azasidirrstgyyuqub51","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/azasidirrstgyyuqub51.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"2e4ad9fc-631b-7661-77a0-3ad9fc3684f3"},{"id":181831,"game":86372,"height":480,"image_id":"g1avxrfcp5viiviueo0g","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g1avxrfcp5viiviueo0g.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"bfeaa9ab-ac25-86ef-ebd8-756d65844d90"},{"id":181832,"game":86372,"height":480,"image_id":"opllo39yfvaxczoupuff","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/opllo39yfvaxczoupuff.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"cc5c15e2-bffc-40ab-af70-c822511fd00c"},{"id":181833,"game":86372,"height":480,"image_id":"pyasl48kpucc87gnoq3x","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pyasl48kpucc87gnoq3x.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"5f8114b4-075e-3cc3-2ce8-d23a0011bfd5"},{"id":181834,"game":86372,"height":480,"image_id":"viu41fqdjgqw6ywqnbai","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/viu41fqdjgqw6ywqnbai.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"0e80eac0-a62a-8e6a-8a42-3a603ad52eca"},{"id":181835,"game":86372,"height":480,"image_id":"lrik8z5padchzwh4yjc2","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lrik8z5padchzwh4yjc2.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"5e85e32f-79cc-1c95-a48d-aff1a465c677"},{"id":181836,"game":86372,"height":480,"image_id":"r6izrzcdrwbzpffdgnpq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/r6izrzcdrwbzpffdgnpq.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"200c3125-1e12-7709-977c-5d04d63c1aa6"},{"id":181837,"game":86372,"height":480,"image_id":"cpomsqqij1wx4ljoiedw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cpomsqqij1wx4ljoiedw.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"ffca9e68-411b-06f1-5dee-cbf60e24ae55"},{"id":181838,"game":86372,"height":480,"image_id":"qciftb3i0gfulh1gy1bt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qciftb3i0gfulh1gy1bt.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"4ba06dfe-d060-29d0-543e-b47fe6d314e7"},{"id":181839,"game":86372,"height":480,"image_id":"berfvhm60qs9puplbbt6","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/berfvhm60qs9puplbbt6.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"3808245a-2368-4ff2-9b36-bbba244bf5a5"},{"id":181840,"game":86372,"height":480,"image_id":"aa0lyajhpe1edy75ivcv","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aa0lyajhpe1edy75ivcv.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"d97648ab-41e4-ac3c-bb66-faca776dfa85"},{"id":181841,"game":86372,"height":480,"image_id":"cvygfj2pykhatzw784l9","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cvygfj2pykhatzw784l9.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"63e52d16-3e39-99c0-1d40-63e8803b9be0"}],"slug":"table-tennis--1","summary":"Developed by Rockstar Leeds in collaboration with Rockstar San Diego, Rockstar Games presents Table Tennis is the perfect Wii gaming experience.

The Wii Remote and Nunchuk are used for both movement and attacks, with motion controls incorporated for special attacks and finishing moves, while the tarantula also utilizes the pointer function to shoot webs. New abilities are also gained as the player progresses through the game.\nAlong with dispatching common arthropods such as pill bugs, crickets, beetles, and wolf spiders, most of which can be devoured to regain health, the player also faces bosses including a Gila Monster, a rattlesnake and eventually a human. The clashes between the creatures are described as similar to monster movies, with a similar impact to battles in King Kong and Jurassic Park albeit on a smaller scale.","total_rating":67,"total_rating_count":7,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/deadly-creatures"},{"id":4753,"cover":{"id":4659,"game":4753,"height":360,"image_id":"r0yrf0efeuvsdyhoeeu2","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/r0yrf0efeuvsdyhoeeu2.jpg","width":252,"checksum":"0dbfbf58-68d7-2f06-8750-d475dad0370a"},"first_release_date":1224460800,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":11428,"company":{"id":277,"description":"EA Canada (also known as EA Vancouver) \n \nLocated in beautiful Burnaby, EA Vancouver (EAV) is the center for development of several of EA’s largest franchises, including FIFA Soccer, NHL, UFC, Plants Vs.

The Your Shape camera comes with the game and, using proprietary fitness tracking technology, scans you, giving you a full body shape analysis. The game combines that analysis with the results of your fitness test and your goals to create a personalized fitness program to help you meet your goals as efficiently and effectively as possible. Unlike any other fitness product, when you begin your workout, the camera projects your image onto the TV. Because the camera tracks your movements, your coach can give you real-time input on how you're doing and advice on how to do it better. And, you get all of these benefits without having to hold a controller as you workout, leaving your hands free to focus on the exercises. In fact, the game encourages you to incorporate your own exercise equipment (weights, balance ball, etc). Just tell it what you have at home, and your coach will add it to your personal workout. No other fitness product provides this level of personalization and interactivity while leaving your hands free.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/your-shape-featuring-jenny-mccarthy"},{"id":60327,"cover":{"id":40049,"game":60327,"height":626,"image_id":"djhdghjpbj21arruqdir","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/djhdghjpbj21arruqdir.jpg","width":522,"checksum":"c3d93f47-f3cc-5ebc-f4f7-6d007a8d57f8"},"first_release_date":1432252800,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":61416,"company":{"id":4725,"logo":{"id":401,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":134,"image_id":"efh8xcpgiss08gym9ebw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/efh8xcpgiss08gym9ebw.jpg","width":182,"checksum":"ee307ddb-7746-7641-a445-27a05b7536e9"},"name":"Alternative Software","slug":"alternative-software"}}],"name":"PSA World Tour Squash 2015","platforms":[5],"release_dates":[{"id":120732,"category":0,"created_at":1508025600,"date":1432252800,"game":60327,"human":"May 22, 2015","m":5,"platform":5,"region":1,"updated_at":1508025600,"y":2015,"checksum":"71d73f3a-272e-135f-b5d5-4fa7ce83d7f0"}],"slug":"psa-world-tour-squash-2015","summary":"Squash simulator for Wii.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/psa-world-tour-squash-2015"},{"id":50953,"collection":{"id":3175,"created_at":1507161600,"games":[28089,43886,44968,46664,46695,49331,50027,50953,56991,134833],"name":"Lucky Luke","slug":"lucky-luke","updated_at":1507161600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/lucky-luke","checksum":"a6b7f062-0ef7-f69a-d14e-a6fa25b7bae0"},"cover":{"id":48132,"game":50953,"height":445,"image_id":"cxitgdkuyrrcz6rgkpoe","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cxitgdkuyrrcz6rgkpoe.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"ab43bf61-1935-fddb-ae29-8a89e811a388"},"first_release_date":1198108800,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"name":"Go West!

ultimate arcade hunting experience to your Wii. Set your sights on dozens of wildlife species and take your shot with simple point and shoot controls. Bag trophies in six different regions, each with their own unique wildlife and terrain, as you hone your skills and become a master hunter. Go it alone or invite your friends as you compete in the ultimate shooting challenge. \n \nFeatures \n \n• Arcade Hunting: Buck Fever brings the familiar “point and shoot” arcade action to your living room. Instead of stalking your target you immediately get into the hunt and start shooting. Choose a region on the in-game Hunting Map (such as Western, Central, Eastern, Southern, and Southwestern United States, and four Canadian provinces) and compete for the top seat on the in-game High Score leaderboard. Buck Fever supports the Wii Zapper accessory. \n• Multiplayer Party Mode: One to four players can join in on a hunt simultaneously. Buck Fever features two unique multiplayer “party” modes: Hunter’s Challenge and Bonus Games. In the Hunter’s Challenge one to four players compete within a time limit for the highest score. In six Bonus Games one to four players compete in a timed shoot-out with inanimate objects (such as bottles and cans) or animal targets such as gopher and duck. \n• Trophy Room: Buck Fever features a Trophy Room that, per player, shows off the diverse wildlife you’ve bagged in the game’s 70 hunts including, but not limited to, desert mule, blacktail, fallow, mule, and whitetail deer, and wild boar. The Trophy Room also displays how many bucks you have hunted, the number of one-shot kills you have earned, the biggest buck you’ve brought down, and the highest overall score achieved while playing the game.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/buck-fever"},{"id":50616,"collection":{"id":4421,"created_at":1512691200,"games":[7034,21350,21382,23552,24145,24249,47432,50616,50617,50618,71469,73233,80460,81142],"name":"Karaoke Revolution","slug":"karaoke-revolution","updated_at":1512691200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/karaoke-revolution","checksum":"6827a3d0-1886-a08c-3f8e-e7c232d719a8"},"cover":{"id":110044,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":50616,"height":853,"image_id":"co2cws","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2cws.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"83b4dc90-707b-da20-5d6f-83fc9e66048f"},"first_release_date":1324512000,"genres":[{"id":7,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Music","slug":"music","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/music","checksum":"22d44a0d-89c7-580f-eef2-e06f178fdd47"}],"name":"Karaoke Revolution Glee: Volume 3","platforms":[5],"rating":70,"rating_count":0,"release_dates":[{"id":96696,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":1324512000,"game":50616,"human":"Dec 22, 2011","m":12,"platform":5,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":2011,"checksum":"b19209ce-972c-8f75-6ae8-10a0b03d4ed2"}],"slug":"karaoke-revolution-glee-volume-3","summary":"Get ready to ’gleek out’ like never before with the McKinley High GLEE Club in Karaoke Revolution Glee: Volume 3!

Mario Kart Wii retains the traditional item-based weaponry familiar with the franchise, where players can select a Mario franchise driver and themed vehicles. As with most racing games, the overarching goal is to place first among other competitors, through the usage of such items and taking the fastest routes to secure the leads. Several new key elements introduced to Mario Kart Wii include increasing the number of racers to 12 racers from 8 racers from previous entries in the series, as well as introducing a new type of vehicle to the franchise: bikes. The game takes advantage of features unique to the Wii, most notably its motion control capabilities. A Wii Wheel is included in most Mario Kart Wii packages, though the game is still compatible with other controllers. Game modes are also present such as the traditional Grand Prix, Versus, Battle, and Time Trial modes.","total_rating":75.66773225553331,"total_rating_count":285,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mario-kart-wii"},{"id":5200,"collection":{"id":541,"created_at":1378252800,"games":[2927,2928,2929,4188,5200,5201,6622,6893,20489,40105,42709,64184,64989,134907],"name":"Super Monkey Ball","slug":"super-monkey-ball","updated_at":1378252800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/super-monkey-ball","checksum":"56659e4b-b9a0-0a41-fb30-b2d4f4c11305"},"cover":{"id":5197,"game":5200,"height":352,"image_id":"jbcfugrtdpjozkbdvezm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jbcfugrtdpjozkbdvezm.jpg","width":250,"checksum":"b24f244c-8f7d-c2f4-4307-6416174c0fa5"},"first_release_date":1163894400,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":12570,"company":{"id":112,"description":"As one of the leading interactive entertainment companies, SEGA cultivates creative talent worldwide with offices in America, Japan and our European HQ in London.

During the action players use the Wii Remote to direct objects and forces toward structures made of blocks in order to knock them over. There is also Jenga like gameplay during which players pull blocks, with the goal of toppling as many of them as possible, but without bringing down the whole structure. In doing this players have to deal with the different types of blocks in play. Some of these include: gem blocks, blocks with point values attached, explosive blocks that detonate on contact, vanishing blocks that disappear when struck, wood blocks, and steel blocks.

They come under fire from the Norts due to the information that had been leaked by the General. Upon landing the first mission is a tutorial in how to use Rogue’s skills and also the Bio-chips of Gunnar and then Bagman. The third Bio-chip of Helm is received in a later mission. The Bio-chips have their own abilities. Gunnar is stuck to the side of Rogue’s rifle and can be used as a sentry while Rogue flanks the enemy. Bagman provides ammunition and upgrades for Rogue’s equipment made from salvage collected along the way and also looks after his health. Helm is used for accessing computer consoles and panels allowing Rogue access into prohibited areas. \n \nRogue works his way through the various levels as stealthily as is possible trying to take the Norts by surprise with kill moves but with the arsenal at his disposal he is quite capable of also unleashing hell and going toe to toe with the enemy.

played by two teams which count eight players each instead of 11, and have an appearance modelled on Wii's Miis (with a Mii representing Ronaldinho, Rooney and others for other licensed football stars, as teams captains: they can be used by the player once winning a match against their team);\n\nAll-Play, an elementary control mode in which it is the CPU to move players on the field, while the unlearned player has merely to push buttons and perform gestures with the Wii Remote without dealing with the Nunchuk;\n\nTable football, no more no less than a table football game (with 13 characters for each team, unlike 11 as in the real table football) displayed by a top-down view, given extra frenzy by peculiar balls such as one becoming invisible after it is kicked, or a rocket-ball.\n\nBoot It, a simultaneous shooting frenzy that the player can take part in as one of the shooters shooter or the goalkeeper\nNew from the previous instalments of the series on the Wii is the possibility to play with the GameCube Controller or Classic Controller for a more traditional gaming experience.

As a pool of water that can take on alternate forms of ice and steam, you must overcome obstacles scattered across the pages of Aquaticus and save it from the corruptive Influence. Tilt and twist your Wii Remote controller to use the various forms and properties of water on your free-flowing journey through Aquaticus, where every page has multiple panels and illustrations that come to life. Tackle problems and defeat enemies to reveal magical Rainbow Drops, each of which will restore some of Aquaticus' power and allow it to open more chapters and grant you new powers. These additional powers, such as sticking to objects as a block of ice or shooting bolts of lightning as a steam cloud, will be essential to destroying the Influence and its minions. Along the way, you can also test your ingenuity and reflexes by finding hidden puzzle pieces. These pieces unlock playrooms that give you the opportunity to use the skills you've learned and race against the clock to complete as many challenges as possible. These challenges won't affect your quest to restore Aquaticus' powers, but everyone needs a break now and again, right?

Tournaments serve as Shimano Xtreme Fishing's primary game mode, each offering unique scenery, time restrictions, and weather effects, but those simply looking to practice their skills or spend a leisurely day on the water can also roam each environment in \"Free Fish\" mode.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shimano-xtreme-fishing"},{"id":4943,"cover":{"id":4917,"game":4943,"height":310,"image_id":"oq7kd17hqbkcqahpfqkn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oq7kd17hqbkcqahpfqkn.jpg","width":220,"checksum":"9226bb1f-3886-1419-83c7-4d98da4f02ee"},"first_release_date":1179964800,"franchises":[{"id":319,"created_at":1391558400,"games":[4943,19958],"name":"Fist of the North","slug":"fist-of-the-north","updated_at":1391558400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/fist-of-the-north","checksum":"0b2b00a9-0331-899f-8290-282377552dde"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":11909,"company":{"id":2211,"description":"Sega Sammy Holdings formed after the merger of Sega and Sammy Corporation.  \nSega was having financial trouble after the Sega Dreamcast when Sammy Corporation bought enough shares to force the merger in 2004. \n \nBoth companies continue to operate independently although Sega took over Sammy's game division so they could focus on their Pachinko and Pachislot machines.","logo":{"id":1132,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":900,"image_id":"t9304pf4hftlppkga1lp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t9304pf4hftlppkga1lp.jpg","width":825,"checksum":"698a1337-ae28-c1f0-57d1-4bd1a0f3f604"},"name":"Sega Sammy Holdings","slug":"sega-sammy-holdings"}}],"name":"Jissen Pachi-Slot Pachinko Hisshôhô!

on an interplanetary family vacation, the young boy Opoona crash lands on Planet Landroll after his spaceship is involved in a mysterious accident. Separated from his family, Opoona is forced to live alone. On the planet, Opoona must find a job, search for his siblings, and defend himself and the people of Landroll against creatures known as the Dark Rogues. Luckily for Opoona, he is the descendant of a long line of warriors known as the Cosmo Guards. Thus, Opoona’s adventure begins as he struggles to establish a new life and reunite his family.\n\nThe game’s action-oriented battle system lets players use powerful “Energy Bonbons” against their enemies. Using just the Nunchuk, players can manipulate an Energy Bonbon’s trajectory in a number of different ways. All of Opoona’s commands are also controlled by the Nunchuk, to allow a complete “single-hand control” of the game.\n\nOpoona is not just about battling; it is a “Lifestyle RPG.” As Opoona, players must adapt to a new environment, meet new people, and contribute to society through work, all while becoming aware of the precious world and people around him.

This means the player can easily create new tracks by combining blocks of track pieces. Besides the normal straight and curved tracks there are also jumps, loopings, accelerators etc. to create custom racing challenges. \n \nThis Wii version of the long-running PC racing series includes six background environments (stadium, coast, island, desert, snow and rally), each with a different car model (respectively the racing car, coupe, sports car, normal car, pickup and mini car). \n \nThere are three modes: race mode, stunt mode and puzzle mode. In Race mode you simply have to finish a track in the fastest possible time. Each track has a predefined track record set by the programmers. There's a bronze, silver and gold medal time, which the player has to beat to earn those medals. In Stunt mode the tracks have a more acrobatic nature, and you have to finish them with as few restarts as possible. In Puzzle mode the player has to build a track connecting the fixed starting and finishing points using certain track blocks and then drive the track in the fastest time possible.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/trackmania-build-to-race"},{"id":5053,"collection":{"id":147,"created_at":1318723200,"games":[802,803,804,805,806,3547,3548,4027,4028,5051,5052,5053,5943,5944,6848,7103,7104,7105,7785,45515,69565,134370],"name":"NASCAR Racing","slug":"nascar-racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/nascar-racing","checksum":"6b02be8f-337d-1a69-3ce4-908914b52707"},"cover":{"id":5029,"game":5053,"height":349,"image_id":"hysupou8jsdltsiztdvk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hysupou8jsdltsiztdvk.jpg","width":250,"checksum":"ca39bb9f-d6c6-7ad4-ffe1-c4c51ddae5d4"},"first_release_date":1234224000,"franchises":[{"id":15,"created_at":1318723200,"games":[801,802,803,804,805,806,807,2898,3547,3548,4027,4028,5051,5052,5053,5943,5944,5945,5946,5947,6848,7103,7104,7105,7785,10075,19806,28829,45515,69565,104983,120487],"name":"NASCAR","slug":"nascar","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/nascar","checksum":"319b3ee0-1fd4-cb6f-9cdc-afd8ef3714f2"}],"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":12188,"company":{"id":454,"logo":{"id":120,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":425,"image_id":"kvwdwqlfil9idhttewhi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kvwdwqlfil9idhttewhi.jpg","width":429,"checksum":"99f482c3-640f-e3b7-1467-a8608978d9a3"},"name":"EA Sports","slug":"ea-sports"}},{"id":12189,"company":{"id":1,"description":"Electronic Arts Inc. is a leading global interactive entertainment software company.

For the first time in the franchise, boss battles crash the party and challenge players to compete to defeat a common enemy. In addition, players now travel across stages together in a vehicle towards a common goal - overcoming obstacles, battling bosses, and collecting Mini Stars stolen by Bowser™ and his minions. Featuring 80 new minigames, adventurous new stages, and all-new ways to play that blend cooperative and competitive action for up to four players*, Mario Party 9 is the perfect way to get the party started. \n \n-For the first time in the Mario Party franchise, each stage culminates in a Boss Battle. Collectively, players must combine their strength to defeat classic foes such as Bowser™ and King Boo while still playing competitively to boost their own individual scores. \n \n-In another first for the series, players ride across stages together in special vehicles. Players take turns as Captain of the vehicle by hitting Dice Blocks to move the party forward, hoping to land on lucky spaces. The vehicles also help to streamline game play and keep everyone involved in the action. \n \n-Unique Captain Events on each stage give players a new way to change the shape of the game. \n \n-In Mario Party 9, each themed stage has a clear destination point but with multiple paths along the way, so no two games will play the same.

Kore Gang is an action-adventure game for the Nintendo Wii. The game is notable for its very prolonged development cycle over the course of ten years, during which many different companies became involved and the game moved from being designed for the Xbox console to the Wii. \n \nIn the game, you take control of three different characters stuck inside robotic suits that amplify their individual abilities. The game-play is centered on the player's ability to switch between the three characters at any time and thus utilize and combine their abilities to solve puzzles. The story revolves around the evil Krank Brothers, evil rulers of a civilization that exists in the center of the Earth. The player, with the help of the three playable characters Pixie, Madboy, and Rex, must stop the Kranks from carrying out their plan to conquer the surface of the planet as well. The plot alludes to the subtitle, \"Outvasion from Inner Earth\". \n \nThe game received mixed to positive critical reviews. Critics such as those for Wiisworld and GamingXP praised the madcap sense of humor and colorful graphics but criticized the clumsy camera control. The game's aggregate score on Metacritic is 70/100.

At the beginning of each round, a mini-game is played that provides the winning players an advantage on the game board, such as an extra die or money. In \"Board Game Island\", the first player to reach the goal wins; and in \"Globe Trot\", which is most similar to gameplay in Mario Party, players travel around the Earth to specific destinations, such as India, Egypt, or the United States, to buy souvenir photographs of the relevant landmarks, shopping items, or cuisine – the player with the most photographs and money by the end of the game wins. \n \nHouse Party Games are activities that focus on the players' physical interactions with the Wii Remote, requiring two players or more. \n \nPair Games are designed for play with only two players, either cooperatively or competitively.","total_rating":68.50849593032625,"total_rating_count":23,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wii-party"},{"id":3244,"collection":{"id":4530,"created_at":1512777600,"games":[2189,3244,5280],"name":"Wii","slug":"wii","updated_at":1512777600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/wii","checksum":"8aae0873-2622-2f67-08eb-326b65b9590d"},"cover":{"id":109710,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":3244,"height":800,"image_id":"co2cni","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2cni.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"5f2cd457-dc21-9f6c-d903-c4e8e2e7827a"},"first_release_date":1224374400,"genres":[{"id":7,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Music","slug":"music","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/music","checksum":"22d44a0d-89c7-580f-eef2-e06f178fdd47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":8457,"company":{"id":70,"description":"Nintendo Co., Ltd. is a multinational corporation located in Kyoto, Japan.

Musicians in your band jam by simply playing their instruments to the beat of a song or by improvising to their heart’s content. Play faster. Play slower. Skip a beat, or throw in 10 more. No matter what you do, Wii Music automatically transforms your improv stylings into great music. There are no mistakes—just playing for the pure joy of playing. Wii controls immerse you in the music. You can play most of the 60-plus instruments in Wii Music using simple motions with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers. Strum to play guitar, banjo and sitar.

Dozens of fast-paced stages offer a wide variety of game play, from shooting stationary targets to defending a supply wagon from onrushing hordes of enemies. Multiplayer modes let players and their friends share a Wii Zapper to shoot for the high score. \n \nLink's Crossbow Training comes bundled with the Wii Zapper. After a few rounds of Link's Crossbow Training, players will be more than ready to pick up any of the future Wii Zapper titles, like Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Ghost Squad and Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles. \n \nLink's Crossbow Training contains three basic game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger. There are 27 stages in total, and these categories represent only generally how each individual stage operates. Each stage's goal is to earn the highest score possible within the time limit. All rounds can be played with multiple players: Players pass the Wii Zapper around and then play one at a time and compete for the high score. \n \nTarget Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen. \n \nDefender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions – sometimes even in a full 360 degrees – by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins. \n \nRanger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments. \n \nThe Wii Zapper requires the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, housing both in a comfortable and intuitive frame. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while simply aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen.

years ago, a suspected serial killer has kidnapped five girls from a sanatorium located on Rogetsu Island in Japan. The detective Choshiro Kirishima eventually succeeded in pursuing the criminal and rescuing the girls. However, several years later, two of the girls died under mysterious circumstances. The three remaining girls - Ruka, Misaki, and Madoka - decide to return to the island to find out more about the kidnapping and retrieve their lost memories. Ruka's mother pleads Choshiro to follow them. One by one, the heroes venture into the dark haunted house... \n \nZero: Tsukihami no Kamen is an installment in the Fatal Frame (Project Zero) series. The player switches between the four main protagonists as dictated by the story. As in the previous games, the characters use a camera to fend off hostile spirits. A new weapon is the Spirit Flashlight, a kind of torch that possesses the power to exorcise spirits with moonlight. Not all the spirits are hostile; the player is expected to differentiate between them, and also capture pictures with the camera to gather clues and advance in the game. Spirit Crystals can be collected and use to upgrade the camera and the flashlight. Healing items and films can be purchased in special shop-like locations.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/fatal-frame-mask-of-the-lunar-eclipse"},{"id":50706,"collection":{"id":3138,"created_at":1507161600,"games":[2758,2764,2767,2769,2772,2774,2784,3794,3911,3912,4921,4922,5072,5339,6365,6366,6565,7562,7569,7982,7983,7984,7994,7995,7998,8014,9751,18306,19092,19967,20240,25165,42478,43581,47420,47879,49373,49577,50706,57980,58455,58568,59042,60961,61012,61204,62555,62966,63640,63643,64711,65056,65058,65157,66734,71180,72293,72530,72997,72998,77045,78281,78800,79779,82098,82100],"name":"Nickelodeon","slug":"nickelodeon","updated_at":1507161600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/nickelodeon","checksum":"fe0b6e96-a29d-bd61-d1b9-280c7f9119ba"},"cover":{"id":27661,"game":50706,"height":1500,"image_id":"mvxhutvj5pwddj0py41h","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mvxhutvj5pwddj0py41h.jpg","width":1078,"checksum":"e6d62585-7a63-820a-ce43-599a1f0f6fd3"},"first_release_date":1291766400,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Nickelodeon Fit","platforms":[5],"release_dates":[{"id":96799,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":1291766400,"game":50706,"human":"Dec 08, 2010","m":12,"platform":5,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":2010,"checksum":"b993ed15-994f-299e-c021-0dd3a9d0ff9e"}],"slug":"nickelodeon-fit","summary":"Nickelodeon Fit is a children's fitness game for Wii featuring Nickelodeon's favorite characters Dora, Diego, Kai-lan and The Backyardigans in one game.

We are determined to set new standards in interactive entertainment and are excited by the opportunity of welcoming such a talented development studio into the SEGA family.","logo":{"id":27,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":1024,"image_id":"hbil3xrhnp8fdust2juk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hbil3xrhnp8fdust2juk.jpg","width":3066,"checksum":"f92f3c11-8dfd-66d0-5eda-f5d60d454831"},"name":"Sega","slug":"sega"}},{"id":12237,"company":{"id":395,"logo":{"id":85,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":202,"image_id":"kknssjawiivmaoqqbrjq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kknssjawiivmaoqqbrjq.jpg","width":666,"checksum":"e151b710-9998-c9f2-8104-1c127087a76b"},"name":"Sonic Team","slug":"sonic-team"}},{"id":12238,"company":{"id":2021,"name":"Sega Studio USA","slug":"sega-studio-usa"}}],"name":"Nights: Journey of Dreams","platforms":[5],"rating":65,"rating_count":2,"release_dates":[{"id":11840,"category":0,"created_at":1391731200,"date":1197504000,"game":5074,"human":"Dec 13, 2007","m":12,"platform":5,"region":8,"updated_at":1391731200,"y":2007,"checksum":"d991f474-2f51-eb0b-3d51-c5520ed342fc"},{"id":141809,"category":0,"created_at":1517616000,"date":1197936000,"game":5074,"human":"Dec 18, 2007","m":12,"platform":5,"region":2,"updated_at":1517788800,"y":2007,"checksum":"b69959a6-1e2e-e2ff-b1bd-80b2e310b47d"},{"id":141810,"category":0,"created_at":1517616000,"date":1200614400,"game":5074,"human":"Jan 18, 2008","m":1,"platform":5,"region":1,"updated_at":1517788800,"y":2008,"checksum":"531bc063-c866-6081-b72a-18b0e20b4737"},{"id":141811,"category":0,"created_at":1517616000,"date":1197504000,"game":5074,"human":"Dec 13, 2007","m":12,"platform":5,"region":5,"updated_at":1517788800,"y":2007,"checksum":"5d5877f2-9d7d-19b5-8c64-9bb817491e9d"}],"screenshots":[{"id":26991,"game":5074,"height":270,"image_id":"t8pnqws6a5q2kngfg2qj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t8pnqws6a5q2kngfg2qj.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"3d200f65-185a-ef0d-d163-16217941d653"},{"id":167281,"game":5074,"height":450,"image_id":"m9udahgj0h0zttcd30xa","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m9udahgj0h0zttcd30xa.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"fea954d5-c3e5-8c08-6c3d-e2db95fab956"},{"id":167282,"game":5074,"height":450,"image_id":"hcsqfedxyluajpmc3y2n","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hcsqfedxyluajpmc3y2n.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"d779123a-aa80-c10a-ee5e-36fa6b0079cb"},{"id":167284,"game":5074,"height":450,"image_id":"fugo0zzxtvstwyp6mmu6","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fugo0zzxtvstwyp6mmu6.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"e4b73f27-c018-7db8-c86b-902201adbc2a"},{"id":167285,"game":5074,"height":450,"image_id":"phcpr9wfb8nyhri5obcq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/phcpr9wfb8nyhri5obcq.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"9e2485b6-2a30-a2a5-3e78-0ea1b33b1130"},{"id":167286,"game":5074,"height":450,"image_id":"g9ieqwaqauwkdqtk77db","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g9ieqwaqauwkdqtk77db.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"240f998d-078e-7f9e-6f6a-c3ad1bd915ba"},{"id":167287,"game":5074,"height":450,"image_id":"qmrfagnhg1impbz8xm9l","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qmrfagnhg1impbz8xm9l.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"0a5b4e09-4f1c-0bb1-ad77-48f72a8c7011"},{"id":167289,"game":5074,"height":450,"image_id":"oju48yx6bbfphvwwroq4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oju48yx6bbfphvwwroq4.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"4004a92f-df7d-5d2e-5476-9a72e8daf8ef"},{"id":167290,"game":5074,"height":450,"image_id":"muicrizkbxtipy5p9mdz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/muicrizkbxtipy5p9mdz.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"ddb1c1a8-48e5-5542-3a2f-a824b618aade"},{"id":167291,"game":5074,"height":450,"image_id":"lesjiwczqchxfistqp55","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lesjiwczqchxfistqp55.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"b1829758-e8de-b02e-a95b-60e7483b47a0"},{"id":167292,"game":5074,"height":450,"image_id":"zcibdbbketbd5hsmswrb","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zcibdbbketbd5hsmswrb.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"bb8c0894-3ca3-30e4-0260-bf1b8121662c"},{"id":167293,"game":5074,"height":450,"image_id":"qnmcey8jtc2wqbkwxes6","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qnmcey8jtc2wqbkwxes6.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"7ca1c291-5786-76cb-081b-3e75db5ea021"}],"slug":"nights-journey-of-dreams","summary":"This time around, however, Nights takes a bit of a different turn. Keeping in line with the \"world of dreams\" theme – it wouldn't be Nights without it – players will take control of Will and Helen, two young children each entering into Nightopia (the world of dreams) with their own back-story, emotional baggage, and inner demons that come to life though the forming of nightmares. It's a pretty simple concept overall, and with each child's five main levels you'll get a different piece of the story leading up to the same grand finale. Once they arrive in the land of dreams, each character meets up with a Nights almost instantaneously, and from there learns to meld with the mysterious creature and fly through the world of Nightopia. Along the way you'll learn of the quest to find the hidden Ideya (basically essences of the human spirit), and eventually attempt to defeat a powerful god-like creature named Wizeman and his right-hand man Reala.","total_rating":68.75,"total_rating_count":6,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nights-journey-of-dreams"},{"id":17450,"collection":{"id":1312,"created_at":1429142400,"games":[3307,3308,3310,3311,3312,3313,3314,3316,3317,3318,10389,17450,19401,19402,19403,23781,25143,45164,45165,45166,45167,45168,45171,45173,45174,45176,57592,59942,65916,71080,71927,72386,73016,78256,78527,79607,117136],"name":"Barbie","slug":"barbie","updated_at":1429142400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/barbie","checksum":"a8d2a320-47f1-c96a-d056-c4e8301b5a6f"},"cover":{"id":110584,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":17450,"height":800,"image_id":"co2dbs","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dbs.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"7c0e0d4e-5fa4-1641-6019-de88b536af6b"},"first_release_date":1316476800,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":32215,"company":{"id":197,"description":"THQ Inc. is a leading worldwide developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software.

When an average housewife in Nerima, Japan, was murdered in a grisly fashion, it gave rise to a curse so powerful that it threatens to kill at a pace thought unimaginable before. The curse manifests on those who encounter the curse by any means, such as entering the house or being in contact with somebody who was already cursed. Once Erika Yamada is exposed to the curse while searching for her dog in an abandoned warehouse, the entire Yamada family is put in grave danger as soon as she reunites with them at home. They must now face their individual challenges alone, and only by overcoming the curse together will their family truly be free again. JU-ON: The Grudge is billed as the first “Haunted House Simulator” where accessibility and instant scares are given priority over story and game play depth. Using the Wii Remote as a flashlight, players move forward with the touch of a button and explore haunted areas such as an abandoned warehouse, a dimly-lit hospital, and a mannequin factory. Much like a haunted house, the player must proceed forward even after being frightened.","total_rating":64.5,"total_rating_count":10,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ju-on-the-grudge"},{"id":18255,"collection":{"id":2090,"created_at":1457481600,"games":[18255],"name":"uDraw","slug":"udraw","updated_at":1457481600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/udraw","checksum":"9aab5432-2b8b-77b4-0e41-30b742ea6bf3"},"cover":{"id":14517,"game":18255,"height":229,"image_id":"c22psvtj78t0rrafpfnk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c22psvtj78t0rrafpfnk.jpg","width":250,"checksum":"35633b7e-f6c9-0c4e-6873-74b0cd9eee5f"},"first_release_date":1289692800,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":33609,"company":{"id":197,"description":"THQ Inc. is a leading worldwide developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software.

The game's plot traces decades of war among six factions (Solar Empire, Western Frontier, Anglo Isles, Iron Legion, Tundran Territories, Xylvania), and unfolds through contemporary missions that advance the conflict and flashback missions that reveal its history. \n \nPlayers control a soldier or a land, sea, or air vehicle to engage in combat directly and to command other units. The Wii Remote is used to target and fire, but selecting and ordering units is performed through conventional button presses. The Wii Nunchuk's thumbstick controls player movement, and evasive maneuvers are handled through gestures. \n \nIn the single-player campaign mode, the player assumes control of the various factions at different points in the conflict's history. The game also features three online multiplayer modes. Skirmish mode is a timed two-player match to score more points than the other player by destroying opposing units. Assault mode is a timed two-player match in which one player attempts to destroy the other player's resources and fortifications while the other defends. Co-Op mode is an untimed two-player match in which both players work together to complete special online missions that are not part of the single-player campaign. Offline local multiplayer is not supported.","total_rating":72.5,"total_rating_count":4,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/battalion-wars-2"},{"id":5211,"collection":{"id":4108,"created_at":1507852800,"games":[5211,11284,37792,69250,72893,77580,77619,77630],"name":"Tamagotchi","slug":"tamagotchi","updated_at":1507852800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/tamagotchi","checksum":"05c24305-9cf7-39d4-251b-19cb4c64241c"},"cover":{"id":5208,"game":5211,"height":366,"image_id":"mtmhpbb6hojnu64crg7s","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mtmhpbb6hojnu64crg7s.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"d4970bf2-abe2-6392-2e3d-42d69fa2df44"},"first_release_date":1165017600,"franchises":[{"id":155,"created_at":1389139200,"games":[3611,5211,11284,20491,26544],"name":"Tamagotchi","slug":"tamagotchi","updated_at":1389139200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/tamagotchi","checksum":"26538bdc-8310-85ca-db15-37c467f4f10b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":12592,"company":{"id":248,"description":"Bandai and NAMCO have both fundamentally been entertainment companies.

His alter-ego Captain Rainbow is a yo-yo-wielding superhero who stars in his own TV show. However, the show isn't popular anymore, because another superhero attracts the interest of the audience. In order to restore his lost popularity, Nick decides to venture to Mimin Island, an island where wishes are said to come true. \n \nIn a dark night, Nick ventures to the island by raft. During his journey, he notices a bunny-like creature desperately paddling in the water. In order to save this being, Nick transforms into Captain Rainbow and jumps into the water. However, his try fails and he sinks. The superhero loses his belt, which is needed for the transformation, and so Captain Rainbow turns back to the ordinary Nick. \n \nWhen Nick regains consciousness, he has been washed up at the beach of Mimin Island. After a short moment of confusion, Nick spots that his belt is missing. Then he sees the belt being carried away by bunny-like creatures who have obtained it. Since this special item is essential for him, Nick starts exploring the island. It doesn't take much time to get the belt back. On Mimin Island, Nick meets various Nintendo characters who also came there because of their own dreams and wishes. During their conversations, he learns that no one's wish has actually been granted so far. Only with the help of a chosen hero, Nick, or rather Captain Rainbow in this case, the wishes can be granted. Nick decides to help the islanders. The hero gets support from bunny-like beings called Mimin, the dominant species of Mimin Island. \n \nThis game was only released in Japan","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/captain-rainbow"},{"id":4893,"collection":{"id":4563,"created_at":1512777600,"games":[4893],"name":"Gold's Gym","slug":"golds-gym","updated_at":1512777600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/golds-gym","checksum":"502b9952-f844-899e-f74c-cbfa502ffe56"},"cover":{"id":4867,"game":4893,"height":363,"image_id":"ax1fao958iwofxdwtaqt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ax1fao958iwofxdwtaqt.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"176f1db8-1af0-8cf7-b968-1ab561da10eb"},"first_release_date":1225324800,"franchises":[{"id":305,"created_at":1391558400,"games":[4893],"name":"Gold's Gym","slug":"gold-s-gym","updated_at":1391558400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/gold-s-gym","checksum":"8036a36c-3eea-7dd1-7cb3-84096478066b"}],"genres":[{"id":7,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Music","slug":"music","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/music","checksum":"22d44a0d-89c7-580f-eef2-e06f178fdd47"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":11788,"company":{"id":2194,"name":"Rocket Company","slug":"rocket-company"}},{"id":11789,"company":{"id":104,"description":"When my brothers and I created Ubisoft back in 1986, we started out with a simple motivation: work with passionate people and make fun games.

The main focus of the game is exploration of the game world and cataloguing the various species of animals found there. Endless Ocean slightly differs from its predecessors in that the traditional \"game elements\" have been mostly removed - where Everblue 2 set a goal for the player by having them search for treasure underwater, Endless Ocean is more freeform and just lets the player explore at their own pace. There are still treasures to find, but as Endless Ocean is mostly freeform exploration and has no overarching plot, the player is in no obligation to look for these items to progress through the game.","total_rating":82.35199951673309,"total_rating_count":7,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/endless-ocean"},{"id":50601,"cover":{"id":27612,"game":50601,"height":2126,"image_id":"ib4zydtoahute7xpvkbn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ib4zydtoahute7xpvkbn.jpg","width":1479,"checksum":"1b250942-293a-e2be-22f7-4b4090a5bdab"},"first_release_date":1278547200,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":79581,"company":{"id":1254,"logo":{"id":1560,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":51,"image_id":"ngwjg7fyr6732pnvctx5","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ngwjg7fyr6732pnvctx5.jpg","width":148,"checksum":"46c8c84d-6847-b299-cc7b-2b7575c4e582"},"name":"FarSight Studios","slug":"farsight-studios"}},{"id":79582,"company":{"id":14055,"name":"Warner Bros.

It features 20 normal missions, ten new hit missions, a new rival family seen only in the new hit missions, rooftop battles, new favors, and other methods such as blackmail and bribery. \n \nThe Blackhand Edition adds a second path that the player may take through the game, that of the operator. The main method of progression is by blackmailing police, the FBI or members of other families, and what the player does or says affects the outcome. While the enforcer's goal is to destroy the other families through brute force, the operator's is to blackmail the police chiefs of the five boroughs by finding enough \"dirt\" on them during missions. The player then blackmails the chiefs, enabling the bribe gauge to fill to the top for free every time the player talks to the chief, effectively allowing the player to take control of the police in that area. The police fight alongside the player's family members and can also arrest or kill rival family members.

Since this revision has been made to balance the game, two characters deemed illegal by tournament standards, Justice and Kliff, were removed from the game's playable roster.","total_rating":75,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/guilty-gear-xx-accent-core"},{"id":67761,"cover":{"id":86288,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":67761,"height":695,"image_id":"co1ukw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ukw.jpg","width":474,"checksum":"4e0bbb82-79cd-5ab7-3517-edb85e8c6720"},"first_release_date":1260403200,"franchises":[{"id":1648,"created_at":1575504000,"games":[67761],"name":"DreamFactory","slug":"dreamfactory","updated_at":1575504000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/dreamfactory","checksum":"fe628f67-4bbf-b468-6921-6885f25bfe03"}],"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":88044,"company":{"id":2028,"name":"DreamFactory","slug":"dreamfactory"}}],"name":"Toshinden","platforms":[5],"release_dates":[{"id":180986,"category":0,"created_at":1575504000,"date":1260403200,"game":67761,"human":"Dec 10, 2009","m":12,"platform":5,"region":5,"updated_at":1575590400,"y":2009,"checksum":"1660a9c3-c304-a320-6728-d9817e4cd801"}],"screenshots":[{"id":346282,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":67761,"height":342,"image_id":"sc7f6y","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7f6y.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"66f4c600-27ec-199f-b029-7284006f3dcc"},{"id":346283,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":67761,"height":342,"image_id":"sc7f6z","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7f6z.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"0f6fd8a2-c21e-c4b3-723b-c1199f0c2341"},{"id":346284,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":67761,"height":360,"image_id":"sc7f70","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7f70.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"8a13c8e9-a6d4-79ef-9552-db09b65b0f13"},{"id":346285,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":67761,"height":680,"image_id":"sc7f71","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7f71.jpg","width":1024,"checksum":"8d34579b-af12-8b51-5a1c-5ebdb4d2a19d"}],"slug":"toshinden","summary":"Toshinden is a Fighting game published by Takara Tomy released on December 10, 2009 for the Nintendo Wii. \n \nToshinden is a wii fighting game with beautiful graphics and excellent fighting styles.

takes place after a comet passes Earth, narrowly missing it and leaving a trail of green dust to fall on the planet. The dust interacted with the plants and fungi scattered around the planet, causing them to become sentient and start to form tribes in order to survive the harsh world of humans. However, a war begins between four mushrooms tribes, the Boletes, the Amanitas, the Leopiota and the Morels.

Warriors: Katana is an action video game set in feudal Japan and is based upon the Samurai Warriors series. The game is played with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment, and the action is seen from a first-person viewpoint. In battle, the player character is equipped with one melee weapon (such as a sword or spear) and one ranged weapon (such as a bow and arrow or cannon). The player can freely switch between melee and ranged weapons during combat. Attacks are performed through either pressing the attack button on the Wii Remote to attack single enemies, or motion-based attacks that can damage groups. The game also includes a competitive multiplayer mode for two players. Outside of combat, there are running sequences where the player must swing his/her arms with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk in hand to simulate the arms pumping in a running motion. Horseback riding is also included, with the Wii Remote performing the function of the reins while the Nunchuk is used as a whip.","total_rating":67,"total_rating_count":3,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/samurai-warriors-katana"},{"id":3388,"collection":{"id":6191,"created_at":1589760000,"games":[3376,3377,3378,3379,3380,3381,3382,3383,3384,3385,3386,3387,3388,3389,3390,3391,3392,3393,20482,20897,42887,42889,43595,47699,47791,49188,67743,67793,73430,78872,134429],"name":"Harvest Moon (old)","slug":"harvest-moon-old","updated_at":1589760000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/harvest-moon-old","checksum":"2549d2d4-cb88-163a-fc47-920eef777c84"},"cover":{"id":101807,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":3388,"height":1049,"image_id":"co26jz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co26jz.jpg","width":786,"checksum":"a7eb9b8b-f111-32ed-c13d-135814e7e429"},"first_release_date":1181174400,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":8848,"company":{"id":1769,"description":"Marvelous Interactive (株式会社マーベラスインタラクティブ) was a developer and publisher of video games, established as Victor Interactive Software.
