There is also Arcade Mode which, unsurprisingly, is a straight port of the arcade game. \nIn this you can select which of 5 events you want to play from day one but must achieve a qualifying mark on that event in order to progress. Once you've qualified from all five events you then move on to the next five in day 2.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/athlete-kings"},{"id":45507,"collection":{"id":717,"created_at":1391299200,"games":[4598,4622,6351,6494,9545,11300,11522,20192,20208,21174,22226,24978,45010,45507,48074,50333,78642,116389,119385],"name":"Contra","slug":"contra","updated_at":1391299200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/contra","checksum":"7c262726-1ba6-5d55-272e-d487df5f0aa5"},"cover":{"id":52132,"game":45507,"height":621,"image_id":"s4fiv6k5ftd7heexjfmq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s4fiv6k5ftd7heexjfmq.jpg","width":547,"checksum":"7fe84d58-7a49-9086-31cb-9cc43c6c92cb"},"first_release_date":854755200,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"name":"Contra: Legacy of War","platforms":[32],"release_dates":[{"id":98891,"category":0,"created_at":1500422400,"date":854755200,"game":45507,"human":"Feb 01, 1997","m":2,"platform":32,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1997,"checksum":"4846f203-e95f-c405-94b9-fcf51f6593ea"}],"slug":"contra-legacy-of-war","summary":"Contra: Legacy of War is a 3D action game produced by Konami and developed by Appaloosa Interactive that was originally released in 1996 for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. It was the first of two Contra games that were externally developed by Appaloosa, followed by C: The Contra Adventure in 1998. The game marks the series' jump to three-dimensional graphics and controversial changes in gameplay. Legacy of War was released packaged with a pair of 3D anaglyph glasses, which the game supported. Legacy of War bears the distinction for being the first console game in the series to retain both the Contra title and human characters during its release in Europe and Australia (where the console series has been known as Probotector from the first NES game and up until Contra: Hard Corps). The game was scheduled to be released in Japan as well,[1] but was canceled.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/contra-legacy-of-war"},{"id":45481,"first_release_date":883440000,"name":"Steep Slope Sliders","platforms":[32],"release_dates":[{"id":98936,"category":0,"created_at":1500422400,"date":883440000,"game":45481,"human":"Dec 30, 1997","m":12,"platform":32,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1997,"checksum":"aaf05bac-6944-7272-c545-2cf5afd30ade"}],"slug":"steep-slope-sliders","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/steep-slope-sliders"},{"id":45376,"collection":{"id":3051,"created_at":1506556800,"games":[21405,26616,37478,37479,37481,37999,38233,38234,42563,44850,45376,49137,56227,58831,61553,65453,66434,70572,71606,72750,72768,72841,72877,76970,78766,78949,79336,79337,79339,79342,79345,80139,80145,80686,80755,112429,112431],"name":"Super Robot Taisen","slug":"super-robot-taisen","updated_at":1506556800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/super-robot-taisen","checksum":"fab1c129-b84b-ecb9-3755-51eab4b67353"},"cover":{"id":56075,"game":45376,"height":500,"image_id":"myjx3h0k2zu4qszcjkxr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/myjx3h0k2zu4qszcjkxr.jpg","width":465,"checksum":"1d6412f1-4ec0-8e99-18a2-3695511b3dd0"},"first_release_date":886291200,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Super Robot Taisen F Final","platforms":[32],"release_dates":[{"id":99017,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":886291200,"game":45376,"human":"Feb 01, 1998","m":2,"platform":32,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1998,"checksum":"45699d8a-eec2-ab26-dfb1-0eb5c23c2c49"}],"slug":"super-robot-taisen-f-final","summary":"The end of the first game \"Super Robot Taisen F\" with more 30 missions to play with the same rooster of giant robots in SD format.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-robot-taisen-f-final"},{"id":45508,"cover":{"id":28238,"game":45508,"height":1400,"image_id":"xeqlmelxqufpzva3z8pd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xeqlmelxqufpzva3z8pd.jpg","width":1400,"checksum":"35681998-db2b-2de6-7ce6-63be22e46c71"},"first_release_date":901324800,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Akumajou Dracula X: Gekka no Yasoukyoku","platforms":[32],"release_dates":[{"id":98890,"category":0,"created_at":1500422400,"date":901324800,"game":45508,"human":"Jul 25, 1998","m":7,"platform":32,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1998,"checksum":"f5184c11-8a17-a238-d6fd-361ed9fffea8"}],"slug":"akumajou-dracula-x-gekka-no-yasoukyoku","summary":"As a descendant of Dracula, you must end the vampire bloodline.

It combines several characters from various Sega games, from the complete cast of Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers to Janet from Virtua Cop 2 and the Hornet car from Daytona USA, while allowing to play the bosses of both games without codes. \nHighly advertised, it followed Virtua Fighter 2 as a high-profile 3D fighting game for the Sega Saturn. Intended as an introduction to Virtua Fighter 3 (which was never released for the Saturn), Fighters Megamix utilized the concept originally used by The King of Fighters, whereby characters and styles from different games were mixed together. Not only the open ended rings from VF are present (but now, with no ring-out), but also the closed cages from Fighting Vipers. VF characters have new moves taken from VF3, but the most impressive feature was the dodge move, which allowed characters to sidestep, avoiding a dangerous blow and opening at the same time room for a counter. Sega capitalized on this, calling Fighters Megamix the first \"real 3D\" fighting game in the market. \nUnlike most of AM2's games of the era, Fighters Megamix did not have an arcade release. In 1998 a Game.com port was released by Tiger Electronics.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/fighters-megamix"},{"id":45468,"collection":{"id":4910,"created_at":1512864000,"games":[19755,45468,45498,45790],"name":"Sega Worldwide Soccer","slug":"sega-worldwide-soccer","updated_at":1512864000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/sega-worldwide-soccer","checksum":"74a1c2a2-c498-7a1b-af63-d310f7f45c42"},"cover":{"id":53933,"game":45468,"height":1090,"image_id":"rxtlrcmtgemzz7m9hamy","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rxtlrcmtgemzz7m9hamy.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"a4bc01a2-8c32-f372-c5d1-79a7e72e77b1"},"first_release_date":886291200,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Sega Worldwide Soccer '98","platforms":[32],"release_dates":[{"id":98953,"category":0,"created_at":1500422400,"date":886291200,"game":45468,"human":"Feb 01, 1998","m":2,"platform":32,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1998,"checksum":"a0510d59-91e3-613e-5307-e3541c74341b"}],"slug":"sega-worldwide-soccer-98","summary":"Sega Worldwide Soccer is a series of soccer games by Sega for initially for the Sega Saturn but later was moved to the Dreamcast.

The game featured international teams and league, play-off and tournament modes. Although it used fictional player names (due to the lack of a license), the non-volatile memory of the Saturn allowed editing of names. The team kits were as close to the official 1996 kits as possible. The gameplay was also highly praised, and was the top-rated football game until ISS 64 was released one year later.

Released in 1994, it was developed and produced by Sega. A well-received home port was released on the Sega Saturn in 1995, scoring mainly positive reviews for its arcade faithful conversion, due to the similar hardware of the ST-V arcade and the Saturn. It was released on the PlayStation 2 in Japan only as part of the Sega Ages 2500 series. Compared to other decathlon based games, Decathlete has a more comic and cartoon like style. A sequel followed in 1997, the winter sports based Winter Heat. \n \nThe game play is largely based on quick repeated button pressing for gaining speed, and timed single button presses for jumping and releasing projectiles, in a similar style to the 1983 Konami release, Track & Field. The game differed with a slightly more advanced control system and 3-D graphics. \n \nThe player must select one of eight international fictitious athletes. In the arcade version, the player competes in ten traditional decathlon events, requiring a minimum set time, height or distance to qualify from one event to the next. The home console versions also allowed the player to compete in a full decathlon featuring all the events, 100 metres, 110 metre hurdles, 400 metres, 1500 metres, Long jump, High jump, Javelin throw, Discus, Pole vault and Shot put. Despite a potential for multi-player gaming, the game is only two player. In a one player game, the player only competes against at most one other character on screen. The only exception to this is in the 1500 metres, where six other generic athletes join the race along with one main character.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/decathlete"},{"id":75875,"collection":{"id":4077,"created_at":1507852800,"games":[3555,23953,43404,59826,61581,61670,61671,61676,65414,65557,67657,68229,69709,72826,73729,75875,75878,75879,75880,75881,75882,78776,79636,80665],"name":"Neon

He is for all intents and purposes the true main character of Shining Force III. His initial motivation as the story begins is to track down and kill Galm, one of, if not the, most powerful member of the Vandals, a powerful race of beings that existed over 1,000 years ago. Julian believes that Galm killed his father and is seeking revenge. This story arc is first introduced in an earlier Shining game, Shining the Holy Ark, in which Julian appears as a young boy who asks the party to search for his missing father. \n \nJulian joins Synbios in the midst of his quest in Scenario 1, but after an encounter with Galm, he is tossed over a waterfall at the suspension bridge and believed by Synbios' army to be dead. He reappears in Scenario 2, apparently washing ashore at the site of a battle between Medion's army and the Bulzome Sect. Knowing the sect's ties to the Vandals, Julian agrees to fight alongside Medion. As it becomes clear that the sect is trying to kill Gracia, a child intended to become the next Innovator (A Shining Series figure equatable to a god), Julian takes on the task of protecting him and helping him realize his destiny. \n \nScenario 3 starts about 60% through scenario 2's story, and focuses primarily on battles against the Bulzome Sect and their allies in both Aspinia and Destonia. While scenarios 1 & 2 happen at roughly the same time, much of scenario 3 takes place after both, but there is some \"overlap\". Eventually Julian leads a three-party coalition consisting of the armies of both Synbios and Medion, to engage in the final conflict against Bulzome, a powerful Vandal long sealed in another dimension, and the true orchestrator of the conflict.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shining-force-iii-3rd-scenario"},{"id":25804,"cover":{"id":81770,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":25804,"height":512,"image_id":"co1r3e","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1r3e.jpg","width":365,"checksum":"0c3fc268-d9fb-0932-1bca-23b9d9740de7"},"first_release_date":844128000,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":41619,"company":{"id":2534,"name":"Zono Inc.","slug":"zono-inc"}},{"id":41620,"company":{"id":656,"description":"Was a game studio which got aquired by Take-Two/Rockstar Games in 2003, and it was shortly after renamed Rockstar San Diego.","logo":{"id":433,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":99,"image_id":"jewl6nu5czolwkso7tr4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jewl6nu5czolwkso7tr4.jpg","width":174,"checksum":"e7da7315-15bc-4469-56a3-2657dfe91cb1"},"name":"Angel Studios","slug":"angel-studios"}},{"id":41621,"company":{"id":568,"name":"SegaSoft","slug":"segasoft"}}],"name":"Mr. Bones","platforms":[32],"release_dates":[{"id":60487,"category":0,"created_at":1479168000,"date":845596800,"game":25804,"human":"Oct 18, 1996","m":10,"platform":32,"region":2,"updated_at":1479168000,"y":1996,"checksum":"1a211ef8-d22b-daab-7896-de4277ff59aa"},{"id":60488,"category":0,"created_at":1479168000,"date":844128000,"game":25804,"human":"Oct 01, 1996","m":10,"platform":32,"region":1,"updated_at":1479168000,"y":1996,"checksum":"e1320538-cb2e-f1ac-79c9-09e9ba1e1c9d"},{"id":60489,"category":0,"created_at":1479168000,"date":867369600,"game":25804,"human":"Jun 27, 1997","m":6,"platform":32,"region":5,"updated_at":1479168000,"y":1997,"checksum":"402a106e-722a-0e92-8cc4-340b750e3323"}],"slug":"mr-bones","summary":"Mr. Bones, is a multi-genre video game released for the Sega Saturn in 1996, created for SEGA by Ed Annunziata and Zono Incorporated.

The special endings available for characters that end with particularly high Heart's Nobility represent the game's dating sim element, but because it is set within the larger plot of the TV series the relationships are usually somewhat platonic, or one-sided affections on the part of the main character.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shoujo-kakumei-utena-itsuka-kakumei-sareru-monogatari"},{"id":45456,"cover":{"id":68286,"game":45456,"height":640,"image_id":"ztkxpixx8icmtd0bx48e","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ztkxpixx8icmtd0bx48e.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"d857ee32-1369-76d5-68c6-d9111918f845"},"first_release_date":853459200,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":69588,"company":{"id":2346,"name":"Time Warner Interactive","slug":"time-warner-interactive"}}],"name":"Shinrei Jusatsushi Tarōmaru","platforms":[32],"release_dates":[{"id":158210,"category":0,"created_at":1536537600,"date":853459200,"game":45456,"human":"Jan 17, 1997","m":1,"platform":32,"region":5,"updated_at":1536537600,"y":1997,"checksum":"f9cc561a-09d5-3787-a974-a49255a7b61b"}],"slug":"shinrei-jusatsushi-taromaru","summary":"Shinrei Jusatsushi Taromaru is an Action game, developed and published by Time Warner Interactive, which was released in Japan in 1997.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shinrei-jusatsushi-taromaru"},{"id":69709,"collection":{"id":4077,"created_at":1507852800,"games":[3555,23953,43404,59826,61581,61670,61671,61676,65414,65557,67657,68229,69709,72826,73729,75875,75878,75879,75880,75881,75882,78776,79636,80665],"name":"Neon Genesis Evangelion","slug":"neon-genesis-evangelion","updated_at":1507852800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/neon-genesis-evangelion","checksum":"51e3ac62-0d98-0b7f-18a3-eec7741f93a1"},"cover":{"id":44581,"game":69709,"height":474,"image_id":"cg87xab4uuy5jazjzk86","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cg87xab4uuy5jazjzk86.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"61e510a8-63e8-707a-bf6d-1f4e0c1bc8af"},"first_release_date":825638400,"franchises":[{"id":866,"created_at":1473897600,"games":[3555,23953,27099,27100,36601,43404,49119,59826,61670,61671,67657,69709,72826,75875,75877,75878,75879,75880,75881,75882],"name":"Neon Genesis Evangelion","slug":"neon-genesis-evangelion","updated_at":1473897600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/neon-genesis-evangelion","checksum":"950a3e4c-af9a-26cf-d403-2f9e64e0c77c"}],"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Neon Genesis Evangelion: 1st Impression","platforms":[32],"release_dates":[{"id":128533,"category":0,"created_at":1510704000,"date":825638400,"game":69709,"human":"Mar 01, 1996","m":3,"platform":32,"region":5,"updated_at":1510704000,"y":1996,"checksum":"f4cbe61a-9ed6-0707-8b7f-1f1a6122deaf"}],"slug":"neon-genesis-evangelion-1st-impression","summary":"The first Evangelion video game, released for the Sega Saturn in 1996, shortly after the TV series's run.

Spinning all four cards gives players a Gold Key; collecting all 32 cards in the game yields a secret code. \n There are some forced scrolling levels in which Pepper rides on the back of his steed Barobaro. Attacking is done not with Pepper's key in these levels, but by firing Barobaro's head at enemies. \n An additional game mode called \"Bosses Galore\" lets the player control either Pepper or Ginger in fighting all the bosses of both Clockwork Knight games one after the other. Doing well in this mode is said to unlock a mini-game.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/clockwork-knight-2"},{"id":3801,"collection":{"id":628,"created_at":1390003200,"games":[2503,3798,3799,3800,3801],"name":"Dungeon

And from a red Jewel, a boy: Astal, whose purpose was to protect Leda. Content with her creation, Antowas slept. \nWhile she slept, the evil Jerado tried to take over Quartilia. To ensure victory, Jerado created a warrior: Geist. Geist kidnapped Leda, and held her at the bottom of the ocean. In an effort to get her back, Astal tore Quartilia apart, awakening Antowas. As punishment, Antowas banished Astal to Quartilia's moon. Leda took pity on Astal, and gave him her jewel. Once Astal and Jerado were dealt with, Antowas went back to sleep. \nHowever, Geist was still free, and Quartilia was not restored from the changes Jerado wrought. From his prison on the moon, Astal witnessed Geist kidnap Leda again. Consumed with the need to protect her, he freed himself and returned to Quartilia.

Although loyal to his father and his country, he senses that there are other forces at work beneath the tensions between Aspinia and Destonia. He attends the conference in Saraband on behalf of Destonia, along with his brothers Arrawnt and Mageron. As discovered in Scenario 1, much of this influence comes from the Bulzome sect, as well as collaborating separatist factions within both Destonia and Aspinia. Medion works parallel to Synbios of Aspinia, often disposing of rogue Aspinian elements to spare Synbios's force from fighting against its own countrymen. At the end of the game, Medion is forced to battle with Synbios' force when Julian steps in to stop them.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shining-force-iii-2nd-scenario"},{"id":46059,"collection":{"id":2155,"created_at":1463616000,"games":[9406,19254,28396,43663,46059,46063],"name":"Shining","slug":"shining","updated_at":1463616000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/shining","checksum":"7a20e64b-dbfd-f083-401e-5bc7df2052f8"},"cover":{"id":28249,"game":46059,"height":2385,"image_id":"me3hf8vfrwrqveggfujw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/me3hf8vfrwrqveggfujw.jpg","width":1407,"checksum":"08dc6e6e-7278-1bb8-bb02-29e5233da728"},"first_release_date":838339200,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"name":"Shining Wisdom","platforms":[32],"release_dates":[{"id":98916,"category":0,"created_at":1500422400,"date":838339200,"game":46059,"human":"Jul 26, 1996","m":7,"platform":32,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1996,"checksum":"9e8651e3-3297-e090-4efc-e8733e5d1c79"}],"slug":"shining-wisdom","summary":"Once, long ago, a fearsome giant known as the \"Dark Titan\" rose from the abyss and nearly destroyed all Palacia before being bound by magic.

There, they meet up with Nights again and re-explore Spring Valley, which has now been Christmas-ified due to the kids' dreams of the holiday season. The trio of heroes must now take down a revived Gillwing and retrieve the Christmas Star from his lair. \n \nThe game uses the Saturn's internal clock to change elements of the game according to the date and time. In November and January, the title screen label \"Nights: Limited Edition\" is changed to \"Winter Nights\", with the lush greenery of the environment being replaced by white snow. During December, \"Christmas Nights\" mode is activated, resulting in further Christmas-themed alterations, such as item boxes becoming Christmas presents, Nightopians dressing in elf costumes, and Christmas trees replacing Ideya captures. The background music is replaced by an instrumental version of \"Jingle Bells\", as well as there being a \"Christmas-like\" rendition of the boss theme. During the \"Winter Nights\" period, the weather in Spring Valley will change according to what hour it is.
