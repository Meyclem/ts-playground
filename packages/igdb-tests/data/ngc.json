Nintendo presents a variety of connectivity options for the GameCube. It supports online gaming for a small number of games via the broadband or modem adapter, sold separately; it also connects to the Game Boy Advance, allowing players to access exclusive in-game features using the handheld as a second screen and controller.\n\nContemporary reception of the GameCube was generally positive. Some praised the extensive software library and high-quality games, while others criticized the console's exterior design and lack of features. Nintendo sold 21.74 million GameCube units worldwide before being discontinued in 2007. Its successor, the Wii, was released in November 2006.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/platforms/ngc/version/initial-version-87dfdafa-bcbc-466c-8286-cc8cccf4daa3","checksum":"f8179178-799a-7e95-4315-0ee24be6b355"},{"id":121,"name":"DOL-101","slug":"dol-101","summary":"No Digital AV Out (component)","url":"https://www.igdb.com/platforms/ngc/version/dol-101","checksum":"b6b45999-cfc9-572b-f6fd-40ab77df446e"},{"id":125,"companies":[{"id":253,"company":{"id":11986,"change_date_category":7,"created_at":1485302400,"name":"70","slug":"70","start_date_category":7,"updated_at":1485302400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/companies/70","checksum":"f130e00e-063f-f7de-fa47-117727fc547d"},"developer":true,"manufacturer":false,"checksum":"80c3ffb6-e4e3-f215-a074-6f55e0320328"}],"connectivity":"Gamecube Broadband Network Adapter","cpu":"IBM \"Gekko\" PowerPC at 485 MHz","graphics":"ATI Flipper 162 MHz (64 Bit, 16 MB)","media":"DVD, CD, GD-Rom disc","memory":"43 MB","name":"Panasonic Q","os":"Dolphin OS","platform_logo":87,"platform_version_release_dates":[{"id":148,"category":0,"date":1008201600,"human":"Dec 13, 2001","m":12,"region":5,"y":2001,"checksum":"969c34dd-ae9c-5a6c-db3b-34068b1a4ee4"}],"resolutions":"240i , 240p, 480i, 480p","slug":"panasonic-q","sound":"81 MHz in Flipper (64 Channels at 48000KHz)","summary":"The Panasonic Q (sometimes known as Q and GameQ) is a hybrid version of the Nintendo GameCube with a DVD player manufactured by Panasonic in cooperation with Nintendo.

It explains how the diabolical Emperor Geldoblame rose to power, and it also fills in many details about the heroes from the first title. In addition, players will learn about the origins of the world itself and why the Lost Ocean is returning. The hero, a blue-haired young man named Sagi, was sent to assassinate the Emperor but found the job had been done for him. Blamed for the death, he's now on the run with two friends - a robot named Guillo and a young woman named Milly. In the initial stages, the player's party will progress in a linear fashion, moving from one area to the next along a set path. After playing the game for a few hours, players will acquire a ship that lets them visit areas in the order of their choosing, allowing them to either pursue optional side quests or blast through the main mission as they see fit. Unlike traditional RPGs, where characters gain levels in categories such as strength and agility, the majority of leveling-up occurs by procuring better Magnus cards. There are more than 600 different Magnus cards in Baten Kaitos Origins, some of which have truly fantastical properties. Players can acquire cards in many different ways, including trading, buying, winning as spoils of war or by creating them themselves.","total_rating":71.5,"total_rating_count":4,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/baten-kaitos-origins"},{"id":78278,"collection":{"id":634,"created_at":1390089600,"games":[2749,3824,4140,18054,78278],"name":"Bloody Roar","slug":"bloody-roar","updated_at":1390089600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/bloody-roar","checksum":"1487c57b-a7f4-f075-b0ee-c36bf453be61"},"cover":{"id":101589,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":78278,"height":800,"image_id":"co26dx","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co26dx.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"b2541d2e-8c4c-5c60-635f-8077b0dc4c1e"},"first_release_date":1016409600,"franchises":[{"id":869,"created_at":1474416000,"games":[2749,4140,78278],"name":"bloody roar","slug":"bloody-roar","updated_at":1474416000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/bloody-roar","checksum":"51495663-8ff0-e373-d292-2f3389eed537"}],"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":82711,"company":{"id":864,"logo":{"id":151,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":44,"image_id":"s8fufvd2iyb27dl9orps","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s8fufvd2iyb27dl9orps.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"a6e09d2e-cecb-0a7b-60c9-bef8fba2b889"},"name":"Hudson Soft","slug":"hudson-soft"}}],"name":"Bloody Roar: Primal Fury","platforms":[21],"rating":70.02549434149981,"rating_count":5,"release_dates":[{"id":173775,"category":0,"created_at":1564876800,"date":1016409600,"game":78278,"human":"Mar 18, 2002","m":3,"platform":21,"region":2,"updated_at":1564876800,"y":2002,"checksum":"24dde8a9-78b2-c068-c054-065138418efc"},{"id":173776,"category":0,"created_at":1564876800,"date":1020384000,"game":78278,"human":"May 03, 2002","m":5,"platform":21,"region":1,"updated_at":1564876800,"y":2002,"checksum":"6ecf2f72-79c0-8670-8b1c-57e92492e915"}],"slug":"bloody-roar-primal-fury","summary":"Bloody Roar: Primal Fury is a fighting game released by Eighting in 2002.

A real item can be turned into Magnus form and stored in a blank card. It can then be taken out from the card and will turn back into real form. Features detailed CG cutscenes to tell the story and turn-based battle sequences.","total_rating":85.0075781411577,"total_rating_count":11,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/baten-kaitos-eternal-wings-and-the-lost-ocean"},{"id":2686,"collection":{"id":506,"created_at":1373587200,"games":[2591,2686,3243,6890,8581,9674,11196,19687,20556,42365],"name":"Star Fox","slug":"star-fox","updated_at":1373587200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/star-fox","checksum":"d5987d78-3f65-b18c-7859-e441e6b1b648"},"cover":{"id":79580,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":2686,"height":1770,"image_id":"co1pek","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1pek.jpg","width":1328,"checksum":"490ebb66-fdbb-0f53-f339-05eb7aceb8c5"},"first_release_date":1032652800,"franchises":[{"id":771,"created_at":1456099200,"games":[1626,1627,1628,2591,2686,3243,6890,8581,9602,9621,9674,11196,19687,42365,90101],"name":"Star Fox","slug":"star-fox","updated_at":1456099200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/star-fox","checksum":"885f57b8-7315-0869-411d-a9390ba807e8"}],"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":6416,"company":{"id":70,"description":"Nintendo Co., Ltd. is a multinational corporation located in Kyoto, Japan.

She lands on Krazoa Palace after receiving a distress call from Dinosaur Planet, but an unfortunate event occurs during her exploration of this location. \n \nMeanwhile, General Pepper contacts the Star Fox Team and asks them to investigate Dinosaur Planet. One of the main reasons for the investigation, is that large chunks of the planet have become detached for an unexplained reason. \n \nFox McCloud agrees to take a look. On the planet's surface, Fox comes across a magical staff that becomes his sole weapon in the game. \n \nFox learns from the Triceratops Queen of the EarthWalker Tribe that General Scales, a member of a different tribe, has stolen the four Spellstones from the planet's two Force Point Temples, causing the detachment of parts of the planet. \n \nTo prevent the planet from breaking up further and restore it to its original unity, The player must control Fox and restore the Spellstones to the temples. Fox embarks on this quest with the help of the Queen's son, named Prince Tricky, a Triceratops who is approximately the same size as a wolf cub. \n \nFox discovers that he must also retrieve the other five Krazoa Spirits to repair the planet, and save the life of another ally. \n \nIn order for the player to restore the Spellstones and Krazoa spirits, they must navigate through the variety of environments present on Dinosaur Planet, exploring new landscapes, facing new foes and receiving help from new allies that reside there. \n \nPrince Tricky helps in certain situations by using his unique abilities. The player asks Prince Tricky to use these abilities by selecting options from a menu opened with the C-Stick. \n \nAs you navigate through the game, your staff acquires new abilities, which are selected by using the same C-Stick menu. \n \nThere are moments in the game that require the use of the arwing, a type of spacecraft used by the Star Fox team. However, these moments take up under half an hour of the overall game time. \n \nThe game can be described as an Action-Adventure, Open World game that contains strong elements of Fantasy and some elements of Sci-Fi. \n \nIt is often described as being similar to The Ocarina Of Time and the other home console Zelda Games. \n \nWhen engaged with an enemy, the combat is real time, meaning each of Fox's movements in combat require the press of the A button, similar to how each sword swing in Zelda or Skyrim require the press of a button.","total_rating":65.0980527029844,"total_rating_count":53,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/star-fox-adventures"},{"id":3243,"collection":{"id":506,"created_at":1373587200,"games":[2591,2686,3243,6890,8581,9674,11196,19687,20556,42365],"name":"Star Fox","slug":"star-fox","updated_at":1373587200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/star-fox","checksum":"d5987d78-3f65-b18c-7859-e441e6b1b648"},"cover":{"id":79582,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":3243,"height":1895,"image_id":"co1pem","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1pem.jpg","width":1421,"checksum":"2bcbb0a1-859a-339e-9e48-72f1130dad9a"},"first_release_date":1108339200,"franchises":[{"id":771,"created_at":1456099200,"games":[1626,1627,1628,2591,2686,3243,6890,8581,9602,9621,9674,11196,19687,42365,90101],"name":"Star Fox","slug":"star-fox","updated_at":1456099200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/star-fox","checksum":"885f57b8-7315-0869-411d-a9390ba807e8"}],"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":8455,"company":{"id":70,"description":"Nintendo Co., Ltd. is a multinational corporation located in Kyoto, Japan.

The game debuted in Japan at the 2001 Amusement Operators Union trade show as Monkey Ball,[b] an arcade cabinet running on Sega's NAOMI hardware and controlled with a distinctive banana-shaped analog stick. Due to the failure of Sega's Dreamcast home console and the company's subsequent restructuring, an enhanced port dubbed Super Monkey Ball was released as a launch title for the GameCube in late 2001, garnering interest as Sega's first game published for a Nintendo home console. \n \nConceived by Amusement Vision head Toshihiro Nagoshi, Super Monkey Ball involves guiding a transparent ball containing one of four monkeys—AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon—across a series of maze-like platforms. The player must reach the goal without falling off or letting the timer reach zero to advance to the next stage. There are also several multiplayer modes: independent minigames as well as extensions of the main single-player game.","total_rating":59.72227512176405,"total_rating_count":27,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-monkey-ball"},{"id":2643,"cover":{"id":79565,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":2643,"height":1873,"image_id":"co1pe5","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1pe5.jpg","width":1405,"checksum":"7ef5d6e5-5b80-2cfc-6585-a9bac925c812"},"first_release_date":1058486400,"franchises":[{"id":60,"created_at":1372550400,"games":[1511,1512,1513,1514,1515,1516,1517,1518,1519,1520,1521,1522,1556,1557,1558,1559,1560,1561,1626,1627,1628,2286,2287,2288,2289,2290,2319,2320,2321,2322,2323,2324,2325,2642,2643,2724,2725,3574,4068,4069,4558,4559,4560,4561,4562,4563,4564,4565,4566,4567,6897,6898,7410,8284,8353,8377,8588,8589,8592,9564,10906,11720,12515,14606,14699,18099,18100,18138,18594,18704,20039,21700,24398,24423,24945,24949,24959,25027,25877,27052,32124,36570,36792,36793,36794,37382,43174,49857,52197,55011,55669,56053,57344,57382,59038,59116,60055,61007,61973,63048,63849,64033,64034,64282,66024,66027,66028,66029,66030,66031,66844,68380,68726,70506,72165,72248,73096,74809,74816,74818,76863,80213,81272,87797,91823,92306,102873,102874,103511,103512,103513,115653,115731,116246,118490,119156,127326,127982,128069,128071,128073,128307,129561,129585,129586,129587,129588,129809,129810,129822,129823,129825,129828,135142,135145,135164,135233,135381],"name":"Pokémon","slug":"pokemon","updated_at":1372550400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/pokemon","checksum":"ad5f9714-9f87-ee7b-919e-571fc848765f"}],"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":6311,"company":{"id":70,"description":"Nintendo Co., Ltd. is a multinational corporation located in Kyoto, Japan.

The player's goal is to help Professor Oak refine and promote his TV network through watching broadcasts with a Pikachu. The game contains elements of the adventure, digital pet, and simulation genres. The player can explore full 3D environments, have Pikachu converse with other Pokémon, and collect various items. \n \nThe game was developed rather quickly as a sequel to the Nintendo 64 title Hey You, Pikachu! and to promote the Nintendo e-Reader accessory, and uses a novel 3D texturing effect. It was first showcased at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2003 and later through a month-long series of promotional events in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. It was released on July 18, 2003, in Japan, December 1 in North America, and April 2, 2004, in Europe. In Japan, the game sold 66,373 copies in its first year. It received mixed reviews, which generally criticized its low level of interactivity and repetitive sound effects, though its collecting aspects and visuals were somewhat better received.","total_rating":53.8833208255873,"total_rating_count":15,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-channel"},{"id":2928,"collection":{"id":541,"created_at":1378252800,"games":[2927,2928,2929,4188,5200,5201,6622,6893,20489,40105,42709,64184,64989,134907],"name":"Super Monkey Ball","slug":"super-monkey-ball","updated_at":1378252800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/super-monkey-ball","checksum":"56659e4b-b9a0-0a41-fb30-b2d4f4c11305"},"cover":{"id":104792,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":2928,"height":1021,"image_id":"co28uw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co28uw.jpg","width":766,"checksum":"e7e30147-aadd-4d70-7040-ded39434e908"},"first_release_date":1030233600,"franchises":[{"id":1068,"created_at":1501977600,"games":[2927,2928,6622,40105,43677,112014,134907],"name":"Super Monkey Ball","slug":"super-monkey-ball","updated_at":1501977600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/super-monkey-ball","checksum":"3803148e-6321-46bf-b563-07783832333e"}],"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":30,"created_at":1320192000,"name":"Pinball","slug":"pinball","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/pinball","checksum":"b5657d72-ee36-0851-58df-e8d2413283f8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":78813,"company":{"id":1096,"description":"Amusement Vision Ltd. was a development subsidiary of Sega created with members from an in-house division titled Amusement Machine 4 Research & Development(AM4 R&D). \n \nIt was shutdown and reorganized back into an internal Sega R&D Division structure after Sega's merger with Sammy in 2004.","logo":{"id":1131,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":750,"image_id":"njtjlrzv4jxmzy8twndu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/njtjlrzv4jxmzy8twndu.jpg","width":750,"checksum":"e72afc2d-1e01-3e2c-bc53-a69441a9be58"},"name":"Amusement Vision","slug":"amusement-vision"}},{"id":101764,"company":{"id":112,"description":"As one of the leading interactive entertainment companies, SEGA cultivates creative talent worldwide with offices in America, Japan and our European HQ in London.

The series follows Haru Glory, a teenager in a quest to find the five pieces of the sacred stone Rave in order to bring peace to the world by defeating the criminal group Demon Card. Mashima created this series with the idea of travelling around the world and was presented with difficulties in its serialization due to its considerable length. \n \nThe manga was serialized in Weekly Shōnen Magazine from July 1999 through July 2005, and published in thirty-five tankōbon volumes by Kodansha. The manga series was licensed for an English release in North America by Tokyopop until Kodansha allowed their contract to expire. It was also adapted into a fifty-one episode anime series by Studio Deen. The anime premiered on TBS on October 13, 2001 and ran until September 28, 2002. Tokyopop also licensed the anime adaptation which premiered on Cartoon Network in the United States on June 5, 2004 as part of the Toonami programming block, and re-broadcast on Syfy in 2009. \n \nThe manga series has received generally positive critical response with praise commonly aimed towards the storyline and artwork. On the other hand, the anime adaptation has been panned for the multiple edits Tokyopop made to the original version resulting in uninteresting and confusing dialogues as well as unappealing music.","total_rating":49,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rave-master"},{"id":124007,"collection":{"id":521,"created_at":1374364800,"games":[2645,2655,2687,2688,10143,11190,44042,58630,61463,78772,78773,109462,124007],"name":"Animal Crossing","slug":"animal-crossing","updated_at":1374364800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/animal-crossing","checksum":"0b5ea4c1-cb44-6162-78ae-bd48f11ca773"},"cover":{"id":100760,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":124007,"height":251,"image_id":"co25qw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co25qw.jpg","width":201,"checksum":"11a6bc05-d1d5-82fa-078a-dfe36ccfca90"},"first_release_date":1056672000,"franchises":[{"id":1820,"created_at":1589155200,"games":[2655,22146,44042,58630,124007,135266],"name":"Animal Crossing","slug":"animal-crossing","updated_at":1589155200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/animal-crossing","checksum":"ef88ac33-3cd8-619d-832b-4ed35899dd14"}],"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":85689,"company":{"id":70,"description":"Nintendo Co., Ltd. is a multinational corporation located in Kyoto, Japan.

While there are a few similarities between the two games, Foes of Ali was developed by a different team, Gray Matter and as such, is not regarded as a true prequel. \n \nThe Knockout Kings game series gives the user a chance to compete against numerous real fighters, such as Muhammad Ali, Eric Esch, Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya, Larry Holmes, Jake LaMotta, Roberto Durán, Alexis Argüello, and Ray Mancini. The duration of a round can be adjusted to either 90 seconds or 3 minutes. In the game's \"slugfest\" mode, fighters can knock each other out at any given moment of the fight, or suffer 6 or 7 knockdowns and still last for the whole fight. There are several differences between Knockout Kings, Knockout Kings 2000, and Knockout Kings 2001 in particular, the most notable being the graphics. \n \nIn Knockout Kings, the boxer sprites, although distinctive, are not facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last only up to 10 rounds and not for 12 as in real life or 15 as in the past. In between rounds, all that is seen is a ring-card girl. In Career Mode, a fighter is made to retire right after winning the title and defending it for only the first time. A created boxer can fight in Career Mode and Slugfest Mode, but not in Exhibition mode. Although there is a training mode within Career Mode, it is extremely basic. However, 2 aspects that Knockout Kings has which the sequels lack is that the referee does a mandatory eight-count when a fighter is knocked down whereas in the sequels the referee stops the count immediately after a fighter gets up from a knockdown, and, in Career Mode, the result of a fight is afterwards seen on the screen as front-page newspaper headlines. \n \nIn Knockout Kings 2000 for the PS1, the boxer sprites are for the first time facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last up to 15 rounds. Sound and Music volume can also be adjusted in Option Mode. In between rounds, you may see either a ring-card girl, a replay of a part of the previous round, or your boxer sitting at his corner together with the statistics so far of the bout. Injury to the face of boxers can also be recognized, as well as his mouth-piece flying out if he is hit by a hard punch. A created boxer in Career Mode can now fight in all Modes. The training mode within Career Mode is more specific. You can now control your boxer while he is training and, in the PS1 version, you can also choose the location of your gym. Each boxer in the PS1 version can also be seen entering into the ring just before the bout takes place. There is also a new Mode where the player can see the statistics and biography of all the real-life boxers in the game, and another Mode in which the player can re-live famous classic bouts. The user-interface and intro-theme of the PS1 version is different to the N64 version and there are also more boxers, while the graphics on each version are similar. \n \nKnockout Kings 2001 contains the same improvements as Knockout Kings 2000 and adds more. Whereas fighters in KO Kings and KO Kings 2000 are either \"boxer\" or \"slugger\" style fighters, the styles of fighters in KO Kings 2001 are either \"boxer\", \"slugger\", \"freestyle\", or \"crab\", and these differences of style are very noticeable during bouts. Commentary in KO Kings 2001 is also far more vocal than its predecessors. During Career Mode, your trainer will occasionally talk and give you advice in between rounds as you progress through the bout. A fighter in Career Mode is made to retire after winning the title and defending it for several times. KO Kings 2001 is also the first game of the series to introduce CPU vs CPU bouts and \"fantasy match-ups\" between famous boxers of different eras, and the first to introduce women's boxing, which is accessible in Exhibition Mode. The PS1 and PS2 versions of Knockout Kings 2001 are virtually identical. \n \nKnockout Kings 2002 changes many concepts of its predecessors, e.g. you have to progress through a number of bouts in order to unlock new fighters. \n \nAfter Knockout Kings 2003, the name of the series was replaced by Fight Night (EA video game series).","total_rating":51,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/knockout-kings-2003"},{"id":100198,"cover":{"id":100597,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":100198,"height":1024,"image_id":"co25md","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co25md.jpg","width":736,"checksum":"954bb18d-6c60-f185-a2cb-d6d70159425c"},"first_release_date":1040256000,"involved_companies":[{"id":85028,"company":{"id":863,"name":"Takara","slug":"takara"}}],"name":"BeyBlade VForce: Super Tournament Battle","platforms":[21],"rating":38,"rating_count":0,"release_dates":[{"id":195748,"category":0,"created_at":1589328000,"date":1040256000,"game":100198,"human":"Dec 19, 2002","m":12,"platform":21,"region":5,"updated_at":1589414400,"y":2002,"checksum":"1c8841a2-58de-e658-3df9-9c507509925c"}],"slug":"beyblade-vforce-super-tournament-battle","total_rating":38,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/beyblade-vforce-super-tournament-battle"},{"id":4224,"collection":{"id":3781,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[4224,37365,37366,41324,44412,48390,60595,65648,65652,65728,71803,73788],"name":"Ultimate Muscle","slug":"ultimate-muscle","updated_at":1507766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/ultimate-muscle","checksum":"3264fb9d-cc1d-7539-7d2b-7920a3764ce4"},"cover":{"id":4458,"game":4224,"height":363,"image_id":"lpvr94nh5mdjyotrezzj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lpvr94nh5mdjyotrezzj.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"bb067aea-dff1-5f46-66e5-ae76c4ad060d"},"first_release_date":1037923200,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":10937,"company":{"id":617,"description":"Bandai Co., Ltd.

Six teams are competing to win a racing championship, the player taking control of any of the two riders available in each team. The game retains the action elements of the previous titles: as before, opponents will try to sabotage the race, and the player-controlled character is able to answer them with his own arsenal of weapons. \n \nUnlike the previous installments, weapons cannot be picked up on the road: the player has to purchase them with the money earned after a successful race. All weapons now deplete the player's weapon bar with each shot. Another change is the absence of the \"nitro\" boosts utilized in the previous entries; they have been replaced with a turbo system, where using the boost drains energy from the player character's shields.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/xgiii-extreme-g-racing"},{"id":4572,"collection":{"id":2183,"created_at":1465689600,"games":[2397,3643,3644,3645,3646,4570,4571,4572,4573,4574,5296,5465,6249,6251,6295,6443,6444,6445,6683,6685,6686,7488,8736,19516,19771,23238,38408,39334,39424,45566,46331,47522,48707,49054,49981,52127,52128,58888,64173,76766,77322,79072,80307,102805],"name":"WWE","slug":"wwe","updated_at":1465689600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/wwe","checksum":"477b2552-47b0-d686-45d0-414404415a5d"},"cover":{"id":79594,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":4572,"height":2008,"image_id":"co1pey","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1pey.jpg","width":1506,"checksum":"9968143a-3fa0-0630-0f55-ee345aad9e2e"},"first_release_date":1125273600,"franchises":[{"id":255,"created_at":1390780800,"games":[2265,3643,4570,4571,4572,4573,4574,5294,5295,5296,5297,5298,5299,5300,6249,6251,6252,6295,6442,6443,6444,6445,6461,6683,6685,7252,7488,7846,8736,18323,19516,19771,23238,80852,99116,119174,121435,121437,132956],"name":"WWE","slug":"wwe","updated_at":1390780800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/wwe","checksum":"34cd281c-d0b5-bdeb-56b9-4c855edf12df"}],"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":11008,"company":{"id":197,"description":"THQ Inc. is a leading worldwide developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software.

Outside of the games, the compilation includes Sonic-themed videos and illustrations, as well as high-resolution scans of the instruction manuals and Sonic the Hedgehog comic covers.","total_rating":79.8156662224296,"total_rating_count":18,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-mega-collection"},{"id":4161,"cover":{"id":4348,"game":4161,"height":344,"image_id":"ye0j73pgxsguiy4wxhdo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ye0j73pgxsguiy4wxhdo.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"0ab46c74-b9d0-baeb-27c2-88068485240e"},"first_release_date":1051747200,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":10812,"company":{"id":863,"name":"Takara","slug":"takara"}}],"name":"Special Jinsei Game","platforms":[21],"rating":25,"rating_count":0,"release_dates":[{"id":9751,"category":0,"created_at":1390521600,"date":1051747200,"game":4161,"human":"May 01, 2003","m":5,"platform":21,"region":8,"updated_at":1390521600,"y":2003,"checksum":"b1227327-3aa7-3af6-6936-f04ad71bcad3"}],"slug":"special-jinsei-game","total_rating":25,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/special-jinsei-game"},{"id":2777,"collection":{"id":244,"created_at":1340150400,"games":[1063,2184,2647,2713,2777,3655,3656,3715,3716,3717,3718,3719,3720,3721,3722,3723,3724,3725,3726,3727,3728,3729,5440,7338,18221,28126,28127,37137,42217,42257,54277,62490,66788,84259,84617,113211,134452,134453,134454,134455,134456,134457,134458,134459],"name":"Kirby","slug":"kirby","updated_at":1340150400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/kirby","checksum":"bffe58c3-d6f7-478a-9a41-02b505b4bfd6"},"cover":{"id":88577,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":2777,"height":800,"image_id":"co1wch","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1wch.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"8c444326-64ae-ffa7-07b7-13707ef23d37"},"first_release_date":1060560000,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":6667,"company":{"id":70,"description":"Nintendo Co., Ltd. is a multinational corporation located in Kyoto, Japan.

It's the first game of the series to be set on a group of islands in the sea. Therefore, many of Link's actions base on sailing and travelling from island to island, making a baton for controlling the wind the key item of the game. \n \nWind Waker is the first game of the Series with a cel-shaded graphic style. Since fans expected a Zelda game with realistic graphics like being shown at the Space World in 2000, the cel-shading look was critisized and discussed controversial for being too cartoonish.","total_rating":89.32473920385685,"total_rating_count":555,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker"},{"id":1700,"collection":{"id":336,"created_at":1351987200,"games":[1700,70741],"name":"Wario","slug":"wario","updated_at":1351987200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/wario","checksum":"7e5befb5-07a4-6edd-4140-9af71e016875"},"cover":{"id":95044,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":1700,"height":1424,"image_id":"co21c4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co21c4.jpg","width":1068,"checksum":"5ad6bb9b-dacc-082e-9432-e57367f27a07"},"first_release_date":1056067200,"franchises":[{"id":24,"created_at":1339286400,"games":[22141,22146],"name":"Mario Bros.","slug":"mario-bros","updated_at":1339286400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/mario-bros","checksum":"eb489cba-bbc3-e320-81d8-fe484c890e22"},{"id":1752,"created_at":1584662400,"games":[1072,1696,1697,1698,1699,1700,1701,1702,1703,1704,1705,1706,1707,1708,1709,1710,1711,1712,1713,50705,70765,85325,90108],"name":"Wario","slug":"wario","updated_at":1584662400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/wario","checksum":"021bcefb-a535-68a8-c758-d6c60651326b"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":8453,"company":{"id":70,"description":"Nintendo Co., Ltd. is a multinational corporation located in Kyoto, Japan.

It tells the stories of twelve characters that span across the world and two millennia who have to deal with ancient forces of evil which have been trying to manifest themselves in our world. Chapters take place in Ancient Rome, Persia, the Middle East, and modern-day Rhode Island. Throughout the game, the protagonists will have access to several weapons appropriate for their era, from bastard sword & gladius to flintlock pistol and shotgun. \n \nThe game features an involved Magic system, which allows different spells to be created through the combination of runes. These spells can attack enemies, dispel illusions, and heal both the body and items. \n \nEternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem also has a unique feature called Sanity. If an enemy sees a character, their Sanity meter drops. When Sanity gets low, hallucinations begin to plague the character. Walls bleed, voices whisper from nowhere, the camera gets disoriented. Sanity can be restored by dealing a finishing move on a dying enemy, or with spells or some items.","total_rating":84.9936909580605,"total_rating_count":35,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/eternal-darkness-sanity-s-requiem"},{"id":3349,"collection":{"id":593,"created_at":1388707200,"games":[2191,3340,3349,3350,18169,133923],"name":"Paper Mario","slug":"paper-mario","updated_at":1388707200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/paper-mario","checksum":"63b31a4b-94fb-7fc4-1df1-425c72b85174"},"cover":{"id":100900,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":3349,"height":800,"image_id":"co25us","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co25us.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"0eb348d2-b132-0047-7850-ba355e990cd3"},"first_release_date":1090454400,"franchises":[{"id":845,"created_at":1470700800,"games":[358,1066,1067,1068,1069,1070,1071,1073,1074,1075,1076,1077,1078,1079,1080,1086,1087,1089,1626,1627,1628,1709,1711,2171,2173,2178,2180,2183,2191,2193,2255,2256,2327,2328,2329,2330,2331,2332,2333,2334,2335,2336,2337,2338,2342,2343,2344,2345,2349,2350,2476,2485,2706,2707,2708,3105,3340,3349,3350,3351,3363,3364,3365,3399,3400,3401,3403,3404,3405,3406,3475,3476,3478,3541,3680,3985,3986,3987,3988,3989,3990,4049,5199,5418,5712,6503,6504,6505,6506,7337,7339,7340,8203,8535,8594,8726,8734,9602,9621,11068,11195,11220,11258,11604,14738,16617,16747,16748,18027,18064,18065,18169,18195,18448,18657,19599,19840,19930,20385,20386,20497,21093,21624,21910,22301,22549,23328,23796,26157,26758,26764,26939,28414,37151,37755,38254,38305,39342,40118,40510,40533,40540,41246,41247,41251,41256,41260,41272,41363,41420,42204,42208,42319,42400,42500,42501,42502,42525,42602,44044,44059,45160,45161,45676,46445,47847,48032,48133,48135,48569,48577,48711,49080,49877,50335,58941,59517,60579,60852,61573,64820,65974,66812,67024,67025,67026,67027,67030,67043,67197,67198,67940,68074,68075,68313,68354,69638,71885,71976,72323,73026,73027,77060,77227,77228,77378,77785,77789,77829,77964,79479,80174,81145,81197,84700,84920,85273,85357,85572,85663,86264,86354,86428,87815,87816,87817,90101,90109,90113,91994,92342,94180,103317,103339,107234,109455,109457,114767,115276,115859,115860,116795,117772,119120,119932,121506,122711,122714,125054,127881,127882,128874,130007,130017,130032,130090,130354,131856,131860,131895,131938,131939,131951,131952,131953,131985,132003,132029,132030,132033,132034,132044,132049,132108,132109,132110,132111,132609,132641,132642,132644,132716,132854,132856,132860,133923,133993,134017,134018,134068,134069,134074,134075,134078,134084,134088,134170,134171,134172,134173,134174,134175,134176,134177,134178,134180,134294,134295,134296,134437,134746,134747,134748,134749,134750,134958,134959,135071,135090,135094,135095,135096,135098,135125,135128,135129,135130,135131,135132,135134,135136,135148,135163,135168,135169,135176,135177,135178,135179,135214,135215,135217,135218,135221,135223,135227,135228,135229,135230,135231,135232,135264,135265,135266,135268,135388,135389],"name":"Mario","slug":"mario","updated_at":1470700800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/mario","checksum":"401b7db5-37b6-038e-60d5-8e81de7022f4"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":8751,"company":{"id":70,"description":"Nintendo Co., Ltd. is a multinational corporation located in Kyoto, Japan.

The success of Metroid Prime led Retro to work on two sequels, and later to become involved with reviving the Donkey Kong series with Donkey Kong Country Returns.","logo":{"id":524,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":236,"image_id":"ruumbaonuylrufbvtkgt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ruumbaonuylrufbvtkgt.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"e9c5ac7e-e9b1-3a78-0d01-ae5babd00676"},"name":"Retro Studios","slug":"retro-studios"}}],"name":"Metroid Prime 2: Echoes","platforms":[21],"rating":86.92282489370899,"rating_count":97,"release_dates":[{"id":110334,"category":0,"created_at":1503532800,"date":1100476800,"game":1108,"human":"Nov 15, 2004","m":11,"platform":21,"region":2,"updated_at":1503532800,"y":2004,"checksum":"13334b2f-e5fb-176d-77b9-65fcb1621163"},{"id":110335,"category":0,"created_at":1503532800,"date":1101427200,"game":1108,"human":"Nov 26, 2004","m":11,"platform":21,"region":1,"updated_at":1503532800,"y":2004,"checksum":"aeed5277-2c0d-b51c-d6a1-12d5c534928c"},{"id":110336,"category":0,"created_at":1503532800,"date":1101945600,"game":1108,"human":"Dec 02, 2004","m":12,"platform":21,"region":3,"updated_at":1503532800,"y":2004,"checksum":"d69b68cb-31df-3e95-cf61-1a091e106bd4"},{"id":110337,"category":0,"created_at":1503532800,"date":1117065600,"game":1108,"human":"May 26, 2005","m":5,"platform":21,"region":5,"updated_at":1503532800,"y":2005,"checksum":"a61762d3-5514-fc10-8f29-da39e5c2fec3"}],"screenshots":[{"id":24516,"game":1108,"height":777,"image_id":"tsxdrekuqk34pls8lpvs","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tsxdrekuqk34pls8lpvs.jpg","width":1589,"checksum":"3f62254e-bffd-b6ca-438e-992c0b8c21ad"},{"id":24517,"game":1108,"height":837,"image_id":"s8gwbarnyidols229qtb","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s8gwbarnyidols229qtb.jpg","width":1589,"checksum":"4be16f00-4e93-7cc3-d7e1-e6d99275e2b9"},{"id":24518,"game":1108,"height":827,"image_id":"enadbvpfjoilnyyoe9nr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/enadbvpfjoilnyyoe9nr.jpg","width":1587,"checksum":"60602235-bb02-d1c4-24d3-3ab4ba88323a"},{"id":24519,"game":1108,"height":827,"image_id":"mm48efy9nu9yb0fm8cka","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mm48efy9nu9yb0fm8cka.jpg","width":1581,"checksum":"afb6ed6b-efb1-2ac8-f43f-9f9ddf5117be"},{"id":24520,"game":1108,"height":667,"image_id":"xhbwjag1pon6v6mn4zqn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xhbwjag1pon6v6mn4zqn.jpg","width":1595,"checksum":"2c0fcacc-d784-aa3b-4901-87b7e05b2643"},{"id":182413,"game":1108,"height":448,"image_id":"lo8xrw0twguuibcfsk0h","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lo8xrw0twguuibcfsk0h.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"ccebc38d-5498-61f7-fe13-1f15ce913572"},{"id":182414,"game":1108,"height":448,"image_id":"l1cwtu2joyziblcofhxw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/l1cwtu2joyziblcofhxw.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"ca2f69c5-32f5-0d48-3b20-6ae5e380be60"},{"id":182415,"game":1108,"height":448,"image_id":"apkwta2sumka41h8tjtm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/apkwta2sumka41h8tjtm.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"8ee8bede-718c-618e-2e00-62db94c1806b"},{"id":182416,"game":1108,"height":448,"image_id":"yngbis1muuqrs8ozs7vb","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yngbis1muuqrs8ozs7vb.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"65b36fec-f7b0-f80f-cbf0-1b78cc9d3c37"},{"id":182417,"game":1108,"height":448,"image_id":"wyawq8rzit35ckcivwmw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wyawq8rzit35ckcivwmw.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"51f25c8f-85bf-0d6a-101d-30550b9547b8"},{"id":182418,"game":1108,"height":448,"image_id":"nrbkjfdmgvhfci52nhft","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nrbkjfdmgvhfci52nhft.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"3c02bc81-4a73-34b9-242a-6eaa533d9b2b"},{"id":182419,"game":1108,"height":448,"image_id":"q0pjh66zs6dzn4eivv8b","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q0pjh66zs6dzn4eivv8b.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"5db17a12-c93e-16b9-f491-fadeecf02525"}],"slug":"metroid-prime-2-echoes","summary":"The sequel to Metroid Prime puts you in the role of bounty hunter Samus Aran once again.

On a stormy night, Princess Zelda and the shrine maidens fear that the reason for these events is that Vaati's seal is weakening. She summons Link and brings him to the castle so he can protect her and the other maidens while they open the portal to the Four Sword Sanctuary. When they do, however, a shadowy figure appears from the portal. This figure was Shadow Link, who then kidnapped the shrine maidens and sealed them in crystals. Link follows him to the sanctuary where he retrieves the Four Sword to destroy this doppelganger. The Four Sword is a magical sword that splits the wielder into three clones of himself. Vaati is once again released and wreaks havoc on the once peaceful kingdom.","total_rating":76.77662380416311,"total_rating_count":37,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-four-swords-adventures"},{"id":4582,"collection":{"id":3075,"created_at":1507075200,"games":[4108,4582,21444,43617,49211,49379,49380,53058,56977,56980,58652,66774,68039,79358,79359,79360,79576,80801,114905],"name":"Yu-Gi-Oh!","slug":"yu-gi-oh--1","updated_at":1507075200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/yu-gi-oh--1","checksum":"0730c009-d9e6-16b4-0483-1a73c35c00da"},"cover":{"id":111444,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":4582,"height":800,"image_id":"co2dzo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dzo.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"756edb18-17d6-ad6e-79e4-2f2987b1ff02"},"first_release_date":1039046400,"franchises":[{"id":57,"created_at":1372464000,"games":[2285,4108,4582,4630,6257,6697,6698,6699,11672,23467,26893,27093,43617,49377,49379,50002,50833,50834,51279,56977,56978,56980,57150,78163,78165,78166,78167,103288,105056,114905],"name":"Yu-Gi-Oh!","slug":"yu-gi-oh","updated_at":1372464000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/yu-gi-oh","checksum":"b22a6356-1cff-4f35-1a21-9038a03ee369"}],"genres":[{"id":11,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","slug":"real-time-strategy-rts","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/real-time-strategy-rts","checksum":"aaa36cbc-2258-8653-a461-1358df8ce445"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":16,"created_at":1297641600,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","slug":"turn-based-strategy-tbs","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/turn-based-strategy-tbs","checksum":"af5d3ecd-2ebd-358b-70df-e9204b9761be"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":11039,"company":{"id":129,"description":"Konami Holdings Corporation, commonly referred to as Konami, is a Japanese entertainment and gaming conglomerate.

The success of Metroid Prime led Retro to work on two sequels, and later to become involved with reviving the Donkey Kong series with Donkey Kong Country Returns.","logo":{"id":524,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":236,"image_id":"ruumbaonuylrufbvtkgt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ruumbaonuylrufbvtkgt.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"e9c5ac7e-e9b1-3a78-0d01-ae5babd00676"},"name":"Retro Studios","slug":"retro-studios"}}],"name":"Metroid Prime","platforms":[21],"rating":92.5390583425048,"rating_count":436,"release_dates":[{"id":27310,"category":0,"created_at":1424390400,"date":1037491200,"game":1105,"human":"Nov 17, 2002","m":11,"platform":21,"region":2,"updated_at":1424476800,"y":2002,"checksum":"e431909e-92ce-2be6-d021-7db4b42be0d3"},{"id":110331,"category":0,"created_at":1503532800,"date":1046390400,"game":1105,"human":"Feb 28, 2003","m":2,"platform":21,"region":5,"updated_at":1503532800,"y":2003,"checksum":"a524e790-d7b1-e1c3-e21a-a4a9f53e3e12"},{"id":110332,"category":0,"created_at":1503532800,"date":1048204800,"game":1105,"human":"Mar 21, 2003","m":3,"platform":21,"region":1,"updated_at":1503532800,"y":2003,"checksum":"4c84f29c-1a3e-c494-5a56-0abe19ab3cba"},{"id":110333,"category":0,"created_at":1503532800,"date":1049328000,"game":1105,"human":"Apr 03, 2003","m":4,"platform":21,"region":3,"updated_at":1503532800,"y":2003,"checksum":"70f490f1-159c-9f7f-d51a-f516f1e4dfb0"}],"screenshots":[{"id":118849,"game":1105,"height":336,"image_id":"koajaesby7cmhujlcwkl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/koajaesby7cmhujlcwkl.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"c426a788-d6b8-789b-ad5a-dfcee13c11c6"},{"id":118850,"game":1105,"height":360,"image_id":"lrx26njeiciksjqby7ou","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lrx26njeiciksjqby7ou.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"0b76b140-6027-482a-ff24-3951e86e2e60"},{"id":118851,"game":1105,"height":327,"image_id":"poegvjadtys8fflxpxnu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/poegvjadtys8fflxpxnu.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"253c28a0-11f3-c40b-f4b8-a206d662fbfc"},{"id":118852,"game":1105,"height":336,"image_id":"vux5gzepdeqvhvm84rcz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vux5gzepdeqvhvm84rcz.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"c96cc1b1-d3e0-fc44-c1dc-7e4b0c234d84"},{"id":165504,"game":1105,"height":360,"image_id":"diemffq1eggulafx3bqm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/diemffq1eggulafx3bqm.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"a5d824a9-29e9-0f16-5aac-f1b9fe991904"},{"id":165505,"game":1105,"height":448,"image_id":"vbdsy0skk851bz9d5xic","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vbdsy0skk851bz9d5xic.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"9cd14e1e-3ee9-2995-5f06-fade462e3360"},{"id":165506,"game":1105,"height":448,"image_id":"iqfqrjvymtqgmy9liedj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iqfqrjvymtqgmy9liedj.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"dd6010f6-332d-fd8d-a2c5-9ebcf835896b"},{"id":165507,"game":1105,"height":448,"image_id":"u8hzyqyvtimflivvlyqz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u8hzyqyvtimflivvlyqz.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"327ff064-efd1-709c-432a-efdf1ec2ba2f"},{"id":165508,"game":1105,"height":448,"image_id":"vbr5pcodmqah56dbsc9v","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vbr5pcodmqah56dbsc9v.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"8be2fa49-c467-7969-049c-928e41f529ad"},{"id":165509,"game":1105,"height":448,"image_id":"jlt7ncnm7cheka0hmypd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jlt7ncnm7cheka0hmypd.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"4c2b6e6a-7f27-a7e0-335c-bf7e30a4fd35"},{"id":165510,"game":1105,"height":448,"image_id":"uu9ch2azikxoc06kdlsm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uu9ch2azikxoc06kdlsm.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"255c516b-c99c-8d9a-781c-b5b3a9ab6449"},{"id":165511,"game":1105,"height":360,"image_id":"odn0rkifmflc0xusbovl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/odn0rkifmflc0xusbovl.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"d4c561ca-5ac1-db62-41ca-2d0e3a91ada1"}],"slug":"metroid-prime","summary":"Everyone's favorite heroine, Samus Aran, is back!

Returning to his bed won't be easy, though, because Mickey must first recover the broken mirror pieces that have been strewn about the house by the prankish poltergeist.

You will also be able to uncover special souvenirs, such as Pluto's collar or Minnie's bow, which are all displayed in Mickey's room at the end of the game.","total_rating":28.3112062476742,"total_rating_count":5,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/disney-s-magical-mirror-starring-mickey-mouse"}]}
