Here, the players race around a race course against the other three characters for a top position in the race. The game's single player mode is Chaos GP, where the player's goal is to win three different circuits (green, yellow and red). Each circuit is made of six different race courses that the player is taken through in succession. \n \nEach race course is composed of a circuit which needs to be completed thrice. The playable characters have rather simple controls, their basic actions being accelerating to move forward, breaking, and moving left or right on the tracks. In tight corners, the player can break while turning in a specific direction, allowing them to drift through the corners. If the player overuses this method though, the playable character starts spinning out of control. Should the player move outside the race tracks, the racer's acceleration will decreases noticeably on the rough terrain. The race track's sidelines also have obstacles that will stop the player altogether if the playable characters crash into them. The player can as well collect Rings along the race tracks to perform special moves unique to each character.","total_rating":31.6577488768507,"total_rating_count":11,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-drift"},{"id":46528,"first_release_date":849398400,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"name":"GG Portrait: Akira Yuki","platforms":[35],"release_dates":[{"id":98389,"category":0,"created_at":1500422400,"date":849398400,"game":46528,"human":"Dec 01, 1996","m":12,"platform":35,"region":8,"updated_at":1500422400,"y":1996,"checksum":"4ce3d92f-7e8c-b67f-7229-b134ba3c4c9c"}],"slug":"gg-portrait-akira-yuki","summary":"GG Portrait: Akira Yuki is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by Sega, which was released in Japan in 1996.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gg-portrait-akira-yuki"},{"id":46692,"collection":{"id":4339,"created_at":1512691200,"games":[38360,42538,46692,67613,80297],"name":"Kishin Douji Zenki","slug":"kishin-douji-zenki","updated_at":1512691200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/kishin-douji-zenki","checksum":"8427fc00-287d-8ea8-4811-a8fb8ee3ec9c"},"cover":{"id":107795,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":46692,"height":800,"image_id":"co2b6b","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2b6b.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"9dfdb62e-4199-e94a-7701-90bdb0ac83eb"},"first_release_date":809913600,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":92403,"company":{"id":112,"description":"As one of the leading interactive entertainment companies, SEGA cultivates creative talent worldwide with offices in America, Japan and our European HQ in London.

Players have to use two paddles; the upper one is used to defeat demons while the lower one helps to prevent the player from dropping to its demise at the bottom of the board. By defeating bad guys and smashing through breakable blocks, the player advances towards the boss of each level. \nResembling a harder version of Arkanoid, the vertically scrolling screen forces the ball to move constantly forward in an attempt to reach the boss. \nOnly the Sega Mega Drive version has a two-player option. Players can choose between three difficulty levels in the Game Gear version and can also select an option to do a time trial.","total_rating":20,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/devilish"},{"id":19753,"cover":{"id":22795,"game":19753,"height":1024,"image_id":"f235j1gvvddgnj0w1a9t","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/f235j1gvvddgnj0w1a9t.jpg","width":715,"checksum":"b60217bf-bb80-6325-f5a3-29194bb46243"},"first_release_date":820368000,"genres":[{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":36928,"company":{"id":880,"name":"Domark Software","slug":"domark-software"}},{"id":36929,"company":{"id":10077,"name":"Teque London","slug":"teque-london"}}],"name":"Wizard Pinball","platforms":[35],"release_dates":[{"id":52800,"category":2,"created_at":1466726400,"date":820368000,"game":19753,"human":"1995","m":12,"platform":35,"region":1,"updated_at":1466726400,"y":1995,"checksum":"db9ec4f9-c9c4-06ea-12de-4ac543559b3f"}],"slug":"wizard-pinball","summary":"Wizard Pinball is an Action game, developed by Teque Interactive and published by Domark, which was released in Europe in 1992.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wizard-pinball"},{"id":46299,"first_release_date":783648000,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"name":"Yogi Bear in Yogi Bear's Goldrush","platforms":[35],"release_dates":[{"id":98382,"category":0,"created_at":1500422400,"date":783648000,"game":46299,"human":"Nov 01, 1994","m":11,"platform":35,"region":8,"updated_at":1500422400,"y":1994,"checksum":"f618f9ec-b7fa-6427-d31f-481abfac8bff"}],"slug":"yogi-bear-in-yogi-bears-goldrush","summary":"Yogi Bear has to save Jellystone National Park from an evil ghost named Jake; who stole the funds needed to keep the park operating.
