There is a rumour spreading around, among the workers, that Uncle Claude is secretly going to increase the prices of his products which might meana the loss of jobs. A vote was taken and it was decided that you must stop Claude by packing away all the products and shipping them off to the shops. You enter the warehouse in the dead of night to start your task but look, there’s Claude!!! \nYou must push the products onto the conveyor belt. If Claude catches you you are kicked out of the door where an ambulance will rush you to hospital. You have 3 chances to save your fellow workers from redundancy but an extra chance will be awarded at 5000 points. You must avoid the deadly spectrims that Claude throws at you when he gets angry. Also Claude has hired the services of Satsuma Inc, who \nthrow oracs from the roof - you’d better watch out for those too!!! You can make your task easier by knocking Claude off his feet.

By surrounding an area of the maze with footprints its content is revealed, which is either a scroll, a mummy, a key, a tomb or nothing at all. In order to complete a level it is necessary to unveil the key and a tombstone. The scroll enables the player to kill/eat one mummy on the level. If a mummy is unveiled it follows the player to the next level. The difficulty and speed of the game increases as the player progresses through the levels. \n \nThe game is for one player only.

is an \"escape from Alcatraz\" style game for the Sinclair Spectrum. The player controls a convict who must bust his way out of prison and escape from the island. In order to do this the player must beat up prison guards collect/ steal/ barter various items around the prison grounds. The HUD has 8 inventory slots, an alert meter to show whether the guards are on the convicts trail, a clock to show the time of day and an energy meter. \n \nDustin involves a lot of point-and-click adventure style trial and error gameplay as the convict needs to collect various items in a certain order and then use them in the right places.

There's not that much else to say about it, but one nice feature is that you can design your own table layouts and save and load them for later use.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/angle-ball"},{"id":13465,"name":"Castle Assault","platforms":[25],"release_dates":[{"id":38764,"category":7,"created_at":1444694400,"game":13465,"human":"TBD","platform":25,"region":8,"updated_at":1444694400,"checksum":"c68e9a42-9071-bc6a-1f17-4df22127daa5"}],"slug":"castle-assault","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/castle-assault"},{"id":13464,"name":"Casanova","platforms":[25],"release_dates":[{"id":38763,"category":7,"created_at":1444694400,"game":13464,"human":"TBD","platform":25,"region":8,"updated_at":1444694400,"checksum":"d3524106-5a64-c0f5-8750-6294641f325d"}],"slug":"casanova","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/casanova"},{"id":12988,"name":"Cyrus II Chess","platforms":[25],"release_dates":[{"id":37379,"category":7,"created_at":1443139200,"game":12988,"human":"TBD","platform":25,"region":8,"updated_at":1443139200,"checksum":"49303645-4dc0-9d95-a075-22304f425b39"}],"slug":"cyrus-ii-chess","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/cyrus-ii-chess"},{"id":12986,"cover":{"id":23979,"game":12986,"height":1280,"image_id":"q7aroeryvkctufz7qtmg","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q7aroeryvkctufz7qtmg.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"5534e8f0-0af8-dae9-ced9-64af9f072aa4"},"first_release_date":504835200,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":46945,"company":{"id":3709,"name":"ERE Informatique","slug":"ere-informatique"}}],"name":"Contamination","platforms":[25],"release_dates":[{"id":69999,"category":2,"created_at":1494979200,"date":504835200,"game":12986,"human":"1985","m":12,"platform":25,"region":1,"updated_at":1494979200,"y":1985,"checksum":"b35a2c09-f943-bd74-15d7-e450f7d16fc4"}],"slug":"contamination","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/contamination"},{"id":13027,"cover":{"id":73309,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":13027,"height":750,"image_id":"co1kkd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1kkd.jpg","width":483,"checksum":"64b2edd3-5e48-22d2-8687-154a9b84147a"},"first_release_date":473299200,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":77333,"company":{"id":4508,"name":"Amsoft","slug":"amsoft"}},{"id":77334,"company":{"id":11000,"name":"Indescomp","slug":"indescomp"}}],"name":"Roland in the Caves","platforms":[25],"release_dates":[{"id":167965,"category":2,"created_at":1554854400,"date":473299200,"game":13027,"human":"1984","m":12,"platform":25,"region":8,"updated_at":1554940800,"y":1984,"checksum":"da20da17-0007-1543-f18f-6eeaa9294701"}],"screenshots":[{"id":297806,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":13027,"height":454,"image_id":"sc6dse","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6dse.jpg","width":718,"checksum":"101448fb-8ab0-bdc4-1273-65cd47914a6e"},{"id":297807,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":13027,"height":459,"image_id":"sc6dsf","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6dsf.jpg","width":728,"checksum":"5a7b44d2-5ca1-3a23-65f6-c5a10b029ddb"},{"id":297808,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":13027,"height":455,"image_id":"sc6dsg","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6dsg.jpg","width":722,"checksum":"ca56f418-9a3a-a6db-d6b5-2d267569e3a8"}],"slug":"roland-in-the-caves","summary":"You are far ahead in time, the year 2464 AD and your Space Time Machine has landed on an alien planet, and being of an inquisitive nature, you decide to explore it.

Since the floors somehow are floating around in mid air it's possible to run off the edge of the floor and fall to a certain death if not careful. There are also various nasty creatures that Binky has to watch out for. These will suddenly appear on the floor and move in one direction until they either get to Binky or fall of the floor. There are also beasts that move straight for Binky but these can be killed if stepped on before they hatch. There are also balls that roll around the floors.

Your task is to cork the bottles and overthrow the evil wizard. \n \nThe player controls a blob or bubble that can roll, jump, use chutes and elevators to move around a 3D system of platforms, towers and slopes. Enemies can be shot with mini bubbles, crabs spawn from generators and bubbles come from the bottles, five of which have to be corked on each level allowing the player to exit it. Since the player bubble has no features, a directional gauge is used to determine the facing of the bubble to show movement direction.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bubbler"},{"id":13642,"cover":{"id":12591,"game":13642,"height":1170,"image_id":"fk8jqaoe6iurtltqurms","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fk8jqaoe6iurtltqurms.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"bfdb37a7-a5a1-ce88-657e-ad2e1bfb6671"},"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"},{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"},{"id":32,"created_at":1341360000,"name":"Indie","slug":"indie","updated_at":1341360000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/indie","checksum":"2522259f-2454-ec02-5dc0-84373e0508ed"}],"name":"Endurance","platforms":[25],"release_dates":[{"id":39106,"category":7,"created_at":1445040000,"game":13642,"human":"TBD","platform":25,"region":8,"updated_at":1445040000,"checksum":"cf67c221-7601-beee-9fb1-1a51466ae56b"}],"screenshots":[{"id":151160,"game":13642,"height":1080,"image_id":"bjht0fz5myswarlj6dg4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bjht0fz5myswarlj6dg4.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"155418b0-0344-bf11-53fb-ecf9e588d80a"},{"id":151161,"game":13642,"height":1080,"image_id":"qijiifmpqg797lon5nzk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qijiifmpqg797lon5nzk.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"c248e028-0e38-70ee-3657-44dcad6733ce"},{"id":151162,"game":13642,"height":1080,"image_id":"aij4741q5xomcx02ejba","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aij4741q5xomcx02ejba.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"b90638cc-fa3a-e5f8-f9ca-d777e32248a4"},{"id":151163,"game":13642,"height":1080,"image_id":"dzvx1jkquaftb9kx0dtf","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dzvx1jkquaftb9kx0dtf.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"1fd290ab-cfd4-7484-7508-d27198a99875"},{"id":151164,"game":13642,"height":1080,"image_id":"urdqa6bewzobbjwxwguu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/urdqa6bewzobbjwxwguu.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"59cf7387-1632-819a-0f56-82d24a735c1f"},{"id":151165,"game":13642,"height":1080,"image_id":"o0xhvnjgrdey8qhfhfyk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o0xhvnjgrdey8qhfhfyk.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"24522f7b-722f-429f-e672-b2ea47d7fada"},{"id":151166,"game":13642,"height":1080,"image_id":"ilnz0jmihkoduuybhuwz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ilnz0jmihkoduuybhuwz.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"48f4497c-4ed4-9062-14f2-9c6be7bd47c5"}],"slug":"endurance","summary":"You have a game to play, but it's not going to be that simple.
