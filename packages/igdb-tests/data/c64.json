Starting at a gas station you are able to control your speed up to 80mph, brake and move left or right as you avoid other drivers and various obstacles. There are three types of roads to drive on and they are motorway, b-road and dirt and you must avoid hitting the sides and drivers or you lose one of five lives. On the side of the playing area are various dials and these are speedometer, fuel which decreases as you drive, and generator which shows your battery power and decreases if you don't drive full speed. You can also see your mileage driven, lives and if you have your spare tyre. \n \nObstacles you encounter affect different aspects of your car and these are potholes which cause your steering to be erratic, road patches which slow you down, avalanches which means hitting a boulder loses you a life, and you will also encounter crossroads with vehicles moving across the screen which need avoiding. Broken glass means you will stop and your tyre will have to be changed with only one spare tyre, and logs will damage your radiator causing your car to overheat. Gas Stations appear occasionally and here you can refuel, fix your radiator and increase your battery power.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/motor-mania"},{"id":13837,"name":"Deadrigger","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":39409,"category":7,"created_at":1445212800,"game":13837,"human":"TBD","platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1445212800,"checksum":"8c226a51-c071-8dc7-8fd2-1006755cb43d"}],"slug":"deadrigger","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/deadrigger"},{"id":25853,"cover":{"id":18801,"game":25853,"height":1395,"image_id":"ewv15zauneibak4cz5wj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ewv15zauneibak4cz5wj.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"63416702-7ae2-80b4-ed81-0f64970cef10"},"first_release_date":441676800,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":41693,"company":{"id":4507,"name":"Alligata","slug":"alligata"}}],"name":"Aztec Tomb Adventure","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":60590,"category":2,"created_at":1479340800,"date":441676800,"game":25853,"human":"1983","m":12,"platform":15,"region":1,"updated_at":1479340800,"y":1983,"checksum":"26ca2dce-f058-c634-7b28-9145261d179b"}],"slug":"aztec-tomb-adventure","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/aztec-tomb-adventure"},{"id":41014,"first_release_date":412905600,"name":"Pacmania","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":91684,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":412905600,"game":41014,"human":"Feb 01, 1983","m":2,"platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1983,"checksum":"b458e2c5-8464-2b79-f266-2cefe5702121"}],"slug":"pacmania","summary":"Pac-Mania (パックマニア Pakku-Mania?) is an arcade video game in the Pac-Man series, released by Namco in 1987 (and distributed by Atari Games in the United States and Europe).

You must fly and pass as many other competitors as you can as you try to get from the start-line to a finish-line a long distance away. To fly your helicopter you keep pressing the fire button to stay airborne and press left to move along the screen. If you stop pressing the fire button then you fall downwards towards the water, if you stop pressing left then your momentum keeps you going until you slowly come to a halt. The race is timed and you start with seventy seconds and this decreases as you race but passing buoys gives you forty extra seconds. \n \nThe other competitors fill the skies and you can avoid them or hit the top of their helicopter which sends them into the water but if you are hit from above then you fall into the sea. You are carrying four fish and every time you hit the water then a whale appears and lifts you onto it's head but at the loss of a fish and if you have no more fish when you hit the water then a shark appears and eats you. Pelicans fly in the air from left to right and if they have a fish in their mouth then when hit gives you the fish and you can carry up to eight. Hit a pelican without a fish and it takes one of yours and if you hit one without carrying any then you hit the water and get eaten once again. \n \nOther creatures to avoid are squids, dodos, and storm clouds which release lightning and if you are hit by any then a fish is lost. If you run out of time then a fish is lost but you are given five seconds to try to reach a buoy. Trees make an appearance and you are unable to pass the leaves and branches so you must fly underneath while avoiding hitting the water. During the race, rafts make an appearance and when landed on give you bonus points for time remaining and competitors passed. Hitting a competitor into the water doesn't count as a pass.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mancopter"},{"id":41156,"first_release_date":1388534400,"name":"Micro Hexagon","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":91750,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":1388534400,"game":41156,"human":"Jan 01, 2014","m":1,"platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":2014,"checksum":"294d4f35-b1a8-05bb-762c-c25f6fe4cab1"}],"slug":"micro-hexagon","summary":"MICRO HEXAGON is a minimal action game by Paul Koller, with music by Mikkel Hastrup.

In addition to watching the clock because of an incentive to collect money, players have to be aware of their fuel supply. Run out of fuel, and you will crash.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/space-taxi"},{"id":13804,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Arac","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":39379,"category":7,"created_at":1445212800,"game":13804,"human":"TBD","platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1445212800,"checksum":"aa36d8d0-f22d-6fd8-e5c2-e110137992cb"}],"slug":"arac","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/arac"},{"id":55205,"cover":{"id":29656,"game":55205,"height":953,"image_id":"egcnvrvwevsv31vnupur","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/egcnvrvwevsv31vnupur.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"ffcf2a75-4793-e43f-2f79-1ec76e2076dd"},"first_release_date":599529600,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":53810,"company":{"id":3715,"name":"Hewson Consultants","slug":"hewson-consultants"}}],"name":"Subterranea","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":110942,"category":2,"created_at":1504051200,"date":599529600,"game":55205,"human":"1988","m":12,"platform":15,"region":1,"updated_at":1504137600,"y":1988,"checksum":"f13dbfb9-b61e-622e-6de0-b1058c7bbb7f"}],"slug":"subterranea--1","summary":"A side-scrolling shoot'em up written by Hugh Binns and published by Hewson.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/subterranea--1"},{"id":41034,"cover":{"id":25476,"game":41034,"height":1564,"image_id":"gxgq3zz3updwq6jevq5y","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gxgq3zz3updwq6jevq5y.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"af87f05b-4b4d-4a70-b037-776787322e31"},"first_release_date":567907200,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":51368,"company":{"id":11667,"name":"Firebird Software","slug":"firebird-software"}},{"id":51369,"company":{"id":11685,"name":"Odin Computer Graphics Ltd.","slug":"odin-computer-graphics-ltd"}}],"name":"U.F.O.","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":87898,"category":2,"created_at":1498608000,"date":567907200,"game":41034,"human":"1987","m":12,"platform":15,"region":1,"updated_at":1498608000,"y":1987,"checksum":"5ded83c7-e06d-d2f7-7110-59b4a6c2eacc"}],"slug":"ufo--1","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ufo--1"},{"id":41151,"cover":{"id":26476,"game":41151,"height":966,"image_id":"iizlr9kqfccvcbksromh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iizlr9kqfccvcbksromh.jpg","width":1527,"checksum":"bfb6d497-a057-3ce3-ebbb-7c8492a29f73"},"first_release_date":476064000,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"name":"Crackers Revenge","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":91722,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":476064000,"game":41151,"human":"Feb 01, 1985","m":2,"platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1985,"checksum":"fb57cf71-5231-1e16-1157-66198f1f8364"}],"screenshots":[{"id":109071,"game":41151,"height":966,"image_id":"mmm4bpr662cbyujf6yov","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mmm4bpr662cbyujf6yov.jpg","width":1527,"checksum":"b314f83f-a196-e7c5-6376-575a65d44505"}],"slug":"crackers-revenge","summary":"All crackers are catched by the cruel software-firms, and your mission is to find 6 keys, and rescue the crackers.

Some enemies spit e.g fire. Destroyed enemies leave behind coins which can be collected. The enemies can harm the knight, which at first costs energy and then leads to death. If rooms that have already been visited are reentered the enemies also reappear! \n \nFurthermore there are door opener in the shape of flashing steles which open different doors in the castle and objects (e.g.in the shape of jugs), that contain energy, water or weapons and can be collected. At the beginning, the energy supply only consists of three energy points, but in the course of the game the energy supply can be raised. If the knight passes a rune stone, there is an important hint to be read. \n \nFurthermore there is a map of the castle's labyrinth, which shows an overview of the rooms that you have already visited.

During the game three contestants (computer or human controlled) compete by answering questions about various TV shows, movies, characters, or actors/actresses. There are two rounds of gameplay followed by a third \"think real fast\" round. \n \nIn the first two rounds of gameplay the gameboard consists of a giant TV with nine channels; one of the players chooses a channel (representing a particular category) revealing a question; the first player to buzz in and provide the correct answer earns points. The are a variety of categories available (some of these are \"video high\", \"cop shows\", \"saturday night live\", \"soap operas\", and many more) which will vary from game to game.

To make your life even harder there is also a time limit, environmental blocks and other gameplay elements that are introduced during the early levels. \n \nGRAVITRIX features: \n \n Hours of puzzle-solving action! \n Two 5.25\" floppy disks worth of artwork and music! \n Password save system! \n Super-fast loading (512KB cartridge version only)! \n Full NTSC/PAL support!","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gravitrix"},{"id":13830,"cover":{"id":49532,"game":13830,"height":128,"image_id":"ivptfvp5hioyo0cb5a6m","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ivptfvp5hioyo0cb5a6m.jpg","width":170,"checksum":"23a4049d-6fcc-c1fb-79c3-971c3f13d4a3"},"genres":[{"id":26,"created_at":1301961600,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","slug":"quiz-trivia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/quiz-trivia","checksum":"256a99dd-dd06-bc0c-d53b-dc3098da4d49"}],"name":"Chinese Juggler","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":39402,"category":7,"created_at":1445212800,"game":13830,"human":"TBD","platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1445212800,"checksum":"a228de7e-ec24-e4c3-1e6a-d73ce9e1081e"}],"slug":"chinese-juggler","summary":"Chinese Checkers for the iPod","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/chinese-juggler"},{"id":11375,"collection":{"id":1529,"created_at":1437955200,"games":[11374,11375],"name":"Clyde Radcliffe Exterminates All The Unfriendly Repulsive Earth-ridden Slime","slug":"clyde-radcliffe-exterminates-all-the-unfriendly-repulsive-earth-ridden-slime","updated_at":1437955200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/clyde-radcliffe-exterminates-all-the-unfriendly-repulsive-earth-ridden-slime","checksum":"4275563f-486e-5f2a-9571-bf1f73a5f61d"},"cover":{"id":15254,"game":11375,"height":434,"image_id":"stiwa4z8meoam7ssbfym","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/stiwa4z8meoam7ssbfym.jpg","width":339,"checksum":"b0d48751-3a94-a7f7-aa3e-0a3d9f770bda"},"first_release_date":725760000,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":34896,"company":{"id":9584,"name":"apex computer productions","slug":"apex-computer-productions"}},{"id":34897,"company":{"id":7146,"name":"Thalamus","slug":"thalamus"}}],"name":"Creatures II: Torture Trouble","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":50097,"category":2,"created_at":1461456000,"date":725760000,"game":11375,"human":"1992","m":12,"platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1461542400,"y":1992,"checksum":"3957d561-4049-bd64-690b-a1ac5d91c3cf"}],"screenshots":[{"id":22834,"game":11375,"height":353,"image_id":"hb3bdoohavrjxhrhwkrf","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hb3bdoohavrjxhrhwkrf.jpg","width":417,"checksum":"0d09c7ce-efbb-73d9-0f40-6d403189a72e"},{"id":22835,"game":11375,"height":260,"image_id":"uqvs2atiyvds28avaljy","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uqvs2atiyvds28avaljy.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"5aca5b19-02da-ba55-6d20-484c0e85fadd"}],"slug":"creatures-ii-torture-trouble","summary":"The game is composed of three islands, each with a set of stages that have to be completed.

Local people tell of strange creatures that guard vast treasures hidden within the castle, though since no-one who has dared to venture inside has ever returned it's difficult to know how much is fact and how much speculation. \n \nNot too far away from the castle is a small cottage which you may as well use as your base. Though now uninhabited remains in good repair, cared for by the villagers who regard it as a sort of shrine. With luck you may find there some items that will help you in your quest. \n \nThis program loads in three parts, but all you need to do is place the rewound cassette in your tape deck, then tap RUN/STOP while holding down one of the SHIFT keys. The screen will be blank whilst each section loads -- this is quite normal. \n \nAdventure programs offer you a chance to pit your wits against the ingenuity of the author. By instructing the computer to do things (move, examine objects, take objects etc) you must attempt to score as many points as possible. Points are usually scored for finding treasures and other objects, and sometimes for visiting particular places. Adventures can take months to solve, and so the best programs allow you to save the state of the game on cassette so that you can continue your quest another day. \n \nIf this is your first adventure you should try typing INFO which displays useful information. The computer will understand a wide range of words and phrases, but not absolutely everything that you throw at it. Some words are standard throughout most adventures -- NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, UP, DOWN, INVENTORY, DROP, TAKE, and SCORE are some of the most common, but you will usually have to experiment to find out just what the computer does understand. And beware, words that are understood in one location may not be understood in another. \n \nQuite complex sentences can be entered, for example, PUT THE RED APPLE IN THE BUCKET. First the program will check that the two objects mentioned are in the room (a room can be any location in the game), then it checks that you're actually holding the APPLE. Whether or not you are holding the BUCKET doesn't matter. It might be that there is more than one BUCKET visible, in which case you should specify the METAL BUCKET, the LARGE BUCKET or whatever. Finally the program will make sure that there is room in the BUCKET for the RED APPLE. \n \nNot all items mentioned in the adventure are objects which can be manipulated. Often they will serve merely to embellish a room description or to give you a hint about the nature of the place that you are in; in this case you will probably be told I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. \n \nAll adventures have mazes. They may not always look like mazes, but if you keep coming back to what seems to be the same place then you are probably in a maze. When you get lost in a maze (as you most certainly will) don't wander about aimlessly, but try to map the maze. TO do this you must be able to distinguish one part of the maze from another -- which usually means dropping some of the objects you are carrying. Of course, you might not ever find them again! \n \nYou can SAVE the state of the game at any time (it's a good idea to do it before doing anything particularly risky). Make sure that you have a blank cassette handy. The command RESTORE allows you to reset the state of the game to one that you have saved previously. \n \n[Note: the box art is from the 1987 'Classic Quests' upgraded version.]","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/goblin-towers"},{"id":47184,"first_release_date":476064000,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Rocketball","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":93784,"category":0,"created_at":1500249600,"date":476064000,"game":47184,"human":"Feb 01, 1985","m":2,"platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1500249600,"y":1985,"checksum":"c2922d90-d738-7f00-4d49-fe47b12025ae"}],"slug":"rocketball","summary":"Rocketball is based on the futuristic sports movie Rollerball, released in 1975, starring James Caan. Rocketball's taglines were, \"The rules are, there are no rules\", and \"This was never meant to be a game.\" As in the movie, the computer game is similar to Roller Derby in that two teams on roller skates travel counter-clockwise around a banked, circular track. The object of the game is to score points by throwing a softball-sized metal ball into a cone-shaped goal target inset into the wall of the arena. Balls are fired into play, in the same direction players skate, by cannons when play begins and to restart play after the ball rolls out of play or a goal is scored. \n \nEach Rocketball team has five active players on roller skates. The four Rocketball teams are Houston (wearing blue), Tokyo (yellow), Moscow (burgundy) and Madrid (Green), which correspond to futuristic city states[4] \n \nRocketball is a full-contact sport in which players have considerable leeway to attack opposing players in order to take or maintain possession of the ball and to score points. Players can use fists, elbows and knees to disable their opponents. \n \nGames have a duration of ten minutes. A typical game will see no more than 15 goals scored in aggregate. Unlike the movie, there are no players riding motorcycles in the computer game.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rocketball"},{"id":12948,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"The Cracks of Fire","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":37323,"category":7,"created_at":1443052800,"game":12948,"human":"TBD","platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1443052800,"checksum":"8a76680d-b874-6895-8f6e-2bf4e4d1ecf1"}],"slug":"the-cracks-of-fire","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-cracks-of-fire"},{"id":61308,"cover":{"id":41301,"game":61308,"height":886,"image_id":"gzhvewbjir87isbqwae5","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gzhvewbjir87isbqwae5.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"39499a0e-c2da-5089-b5f3-9aa9737f7cc9"},"first_release_date":441676800,"genres":[{"id":30,"created_at":1320192000,"name":"Pinball","slug":"pinball","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/pinball","checksum":"b5657d72-ee36-0851-58df-e8d2413283f8"}],"name":"Pinball Spectacular","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":121250,"category":0,"created_at":1508025600,"date":441676800,"game":61308,"human":"Dec 31, 1983","m":12,"platform":15,"region":2,"updated_at":1508025600,"y":1983,"checksum":"4c1d3176-d1c6-9410-1243-c592fa1a165f"}],"slug":"pinball-spectacular","summary":"Pinball Spectacular (AKA Pin Ball) is a pinball simulation game for Commodore computers from HAL Laboratory.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pinball-spectacular"},{"id":47221,"first_release_date":494121600,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"name":"Big Mac - The Mad Maintenance Man","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":93812,"category":0,"created_at":1500249600,"date":494121600,"game":47221,"human":"Aug 29, 1985","m":8,"platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1500249600,"y":1985,"checksum":"de83e6d0-691d-27f1-9997-56876e0aa149"}],"slug":"big-mac-the-mad-maintenance-man","summary":"Mac must neutralise various single-screen vaults in this early platformer.

The fiend who trapped the two of you is the evil Dr. Graves, who happens to be a surgeon gone completely mad! Although at first glance the island seems pretty nice, with some beautiful green hills and forests, making it a nice setting for your own little private version of The Blue Lagoon, it soon becomes apparent that some very creepy characters inhabit this piece of land. In mansions, castles, a church and even a pyramid live Dracula, Frankenstein, a werewolf, a mummy, a witch and a rather funny looking deformed guy. And if being on the same little continent with these creeps isn’t enough, you actually have got to kill them all before you can leave the island… it just isn’t your day! The monsters are hiding in the different buildings on the island and to kill them you’ll have to find an appropriate weapon. For example, to kill Dracula, you’ll need a stake and a hammer and to kill the werewolf a gun with some silver bullets might be useful. All the necessary weapons are too scattered among the different buildings, but not necessarily in the same building as the monster it is suitable for. So you’ll have to roam the island searching through the various buildings, looking for the weapons and the monsters to use them on. One weapon can be held at a time, so remember where all the monsters and different weapons are hidden, when you see them, so you can find them later on when needed.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/scary-monsters"},{"id":41199,"first_release_date":481161600,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Piracy","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":91755,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":481161600,"game":41199,"human":"Apr 01, 1985","m":4,"platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1985,"checksum":"18525962-7537-9098-a391-93536f17de10"}],"screenshots":[{"id":109073,"game":41199,"height":627,"image_id":"sxnogpm1svwhkhwxwbic","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sxnogpm1svwhkhwxwbic.jpg","width":990,"checksum":"08f4f294-8310-774e-9557-7b9812ca6e51"},{"id":109074,"game":41199,"height":626,"image_id":"gn1td172jvevcv9ojmyf","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gn1td172jvevcv9ojmyf.jpg","width":988,"checksum":"edba9848-67ac-1b10-5f09-08a72af49647"},{"id":109075,"game":41199,"height":629,"image_id":"objprgzmdkmzlprodri4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/objprgzmdkmzlprodri4.jpg","width":989,"checksum":"9ba6f779-eedc-52a0-d83c-4f521eb25a62"},{"id":109076,"game":41199,"height":631,"image_id":"qkadc6sd4mahlxryfbep","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qkadc6sd4mahlxryfbep.jpg","width":992,"checksum":"d4e6bff7-1d78-f804-d2a5-1a119411e8d3"}],"slug":"piracy","summary":"Brilliant logic game about piracy of vessels battle well done. \n \nThe task regards 15 pirates on any of the two ship who must infiltrate into the enemy’s ship as they must do in your.

It also featured sampled sound from the 1984 Bruce Lee game in addition to some new ones.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bruce-lee-ii"},{"id":13806,"name":"Astral Attack","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":39381,"category":7,"created_at":1445212800,"game":13806,"human":"TBD","platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1445212800,"checksum":"2ec366e7-853d-53a2-a120-c2940b87d7cb"}],"slug":"astral-attack","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/astral-attack"},{"id":40945,"first_release_date":465436800,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"name":"Falcon Patrol II","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":91670,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":465436800,"game":40945,"human":"Oct 01, 1984","m":10,"platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1984,"checksum":"6d1e1cde-045b-66d2-b163-331e7504e323"}],"slug":"falcon-patrol-ii","summary":"Just like it's predecessor, Falcon Patrol II is a two-way side-scrolling shooter that sees the player controlling a jet fighting off different enemies. A small radar shows the positions of the enemies and landing platforms (where the jet can be refueled and re-armed).

Apart from helicopters that directly attack the jet, there are also unarmed support helicopters that drop anti-aircraft guns and radar jammers.

When he is in line you press the fire button to drop him on the bike. \n \nLog Jumping: Ride the motorbike along the road and either avoid the logs or bunny-jump over them. \n \nFire-Hoop Jumping: Avoiding the obstacles on the road, you ride your motorbike towards rings of fire. At the right time you have to jump of the bike and fly through each hoop and land land back on your bike. \n \nLorry Catching: You have to ride the motorbike trying to catch a lorry driving on the road. Avoid the obstacles while trying to catch it before driving onto a ramp onto the back. \n \nHelicopter Hanging: A helicopter is flying overhead and you must ride underneath it and attempt to jump of the motorbike and catch a hanger. On the road are obstacles which must be avoided. \n \nStunt Bike Simulator is viewed from the side and scrolls from right to left. You can control the speed of the bike but it always moves. On each task you start with 5000 points and decreases as the task is played. The quicker you complete it the higher the score. Hitting obstacles loses points and slows the bike down.

Knight Lore, the first of the Filmation games, has been retrospectively described in the press as \"seminal ... revolutionary\".\n\nBy the time of the label's last use in 1988 on a retrospective compilation, Ultimate had evolved into Rare, and moved on to developing titles for Nintendo consoles. Rare was purchased by Microsoft in 2002 for US$377 million, a record price for a video game developer, and now develops exclusively for Microsoft's Xbox One console.

Deadly phoenixes firing at you come next, followed by the Mega Phoenix itself and then a final boss, before it all repeats with higher difficulty.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mega-phoenix"},{"id":47239,"first_release_date":444441600,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"White Viper","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":93827,"category":0,"created_at":1500249600,"date":444441600,"game":47239,"human":"Feb 01, 1984","m":2,"platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1500249600,"y":1984,"checksum":"9532ea6d-71be-fa32-6962-42770af83002"}],"slug":"white-viper","summary":"White Viper -- an epic saga of true love and bravery -- in five parts.

Above your spaceship hangs a nest of space-vultures. One after one, they come down to shoot at you. Unlike Galaga, they don't wrap at the end of the screen, instead they \"bounce\" back and forth across it. Mind the vulture's course, because otherwise you might find yourself trapped in a corner with the inevitable collision as only way out. A good tactic to ameliorate your chances is to dodge the vulture's bullets and concentrate your fire on its mates that are left hanging above. When all the vultures are killed, their eggs start to hatch and spawn similarly devious creatures. Shoot them down, and you have passed the first level. \n \nVultures has three speed settings and runs in medium resolution with a green background.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/vultures"},{"id":36554,"collection":{"id":2741,"created_at":1496102400,"games":[36554,36555],"name":"Cyborg","slug":"cyborg","updated_at":1496102400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/cyborg","checksum":"de3d163c-66fa-252e-f62a-734430dca598"},"cover":{"id":24233,"game":36554,"height":1436,"image_id":"w0jult1ledxucqtow3pk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w0jult1ledxucqtow3pk.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"5d611d81-6e05-b4e1-0ec8-933f5679e1cb"},"first_release_date":567907200,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":48687,"company":{"id":11151,"name":"CRL Group PLC","slug":"crl-group-plc"}}],"name":"Cyborg","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":76230,"category":2,"created_at":1496102400,"date":567907200,"game":36554,"human":"1987","m":12,"platform":15,"region":1,"updated_at":1496102400,"y":1987,"checksum":"0533eb96-4197-0f75-561a-e83b209d47b6"}],"slug":"cyborg--1","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/cyborg--1"},{"id":61520,"first_release_date":473299200,"name":"Killerwatt","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":121317,"category":0,"created_at":1508025600,"date":473299200,"game":61520,"human":"Dec 31, 1984","m":12,"platform":15,"region":1,"updated_at":1508025600,"y":1984,"checksum":"d9922a29-06b2-9b6f-af61-88505e251919"}],"slug":"killerwatt","summary":"Horizontal Shoot em Up by Alligata Software released in 1984.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/killerwatt"},{"id":47237,"cover":{"id":70967,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":47237,"height":369,"image_id":"co1irb","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1irb.jpg","width":269,"checksum":"d050a7a0-66a9-9eed-aa88-9528176341d3"},"first_release_date":444441600,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":73323,"company":{"id":4886,"name":"First Star Software","slug":"first-star-software"}}],"name":"Boulderdash","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":93829,"category":0,"created_at":1500249600,"date":444441600,"game":47237,"human":"Feb 01, 1984","m":2,"platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1500249600,"y":1984,"checksum":"dcf9fdea-e641-306e-afd6-5aa8979faae1"}],"screenshots":[{"id":279092,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":47237,"height":360,"image_id":"sc5zck","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5zck.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"02d7b616-a0ce-4a53-0440-a57b99b274c6"},{"id":279093,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":47237,"height":360,"image_id":"sc5zcl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5zcl.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"1b78eafc-ee21-ec36-4ee3-3392b1b65574"},{"id":279094,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":47237,"height":360,"image_id":"sc5zcm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5zcm.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"d524a0a2-7ed8-6c63-c1c8-3cad9e07ebf0"}],"slug":"boulderdash","summary":"his classic game is about a diamond chase underground with many obstacles. Try - as Rockford - to collect all required diamonds in a total of 16 caves (A-P) each with 5 difficulty levels, and find the exit in the time given. After every 4 caves (D, H, L, P) follows a so-called \"intermission\", a logical puzzle (without its own \"cave letter\"). Rockford can dig through the ground and push rocks. But these can also be dangerous. If he stands directly below a rock, Rockford can hold it on his head. But if a rock falls on his head, it will cost him a life. Rocks will not stay on each other or on walls. If Rockford digs away the supporting soil, rocks will start to slide. Furthermore, there are some not-so-friendly animals such as fireflies, amoeba and other things you'd better not touch. Butterflies and other inhabitants of the underground can only be defeated by letting rocks fall on them. When defeated, they turn into diamonds, which Rockford can pick up. As soon as the necessary amount of jewels has been collected (the number is shown in the upper bar), the escape tunnel opens into the next level. Strategy and thoughtful planning is the basis to master this game.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/boulderdash"},{"id":12956,"name":"Necris Dome","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":37335,"category":7,"created_at":1443052800,"game":12956,"human":"TBD","platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1443052800,"checksum":"153ca9b9-3f99-a310-c1ae-f084da5d489d"}],"slug":"necris-dome","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/necris-dome"},{"id":36919,"cover":{"id":24529,"game":36919,"height":1565,"image_id":"g1ar72nkuam8ode8qi4h","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g1ar72nkuam8ode8qi4h.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"e30542fb-10dd-ff40-3654-9132709e2b71"},"first_release_date":536371200,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":50612,"company":{"id":8108,"name":"Virgin Games Ltd.","slug":"virgin-games-ltd"}}],"name":"Erebus","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":83572,"category":2,"created_at":1497052800,"date":536371200,"game":36919,"human":"1986","m":12,"platform":15,"region":1,"updated_at":1497052800,"y":1986,"checksum":"ec0e0b18-b1ba-c11b-ff42-a5484617cb7b"}],"slug":"erebus","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/erebus"},{"id":47252,"first_release_date":1428710400,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"The Vice Squad","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":93824,"category":0,"created_at":1500249600,"date":1428710400,"game":47252,"human":"Apr 11, 2015","m":4,"platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1500249600,"y":2015,"checksum":"5881ab3c-b3f4-6fdb-1a6a-9b47061fa5a8"}],"slug":"the-vice-squad","summary":"Remember the 1980's action-packed, vigilante-cop car-chase movie \"The Vice Squad\"?

A maze of streets, alleyways and cul-de-sacs are laid out, populated by bizarre characters, some helpful and some deadly. \n \nThe street names are named after famous songs (\"Blackberry Way\", \"Desolation Row\", etc.) - a map was provided in the cassette inlay - and some of the characters reference others (one to avoid is the Psycho Killer, while the Jumpin' Jack Flash It's A Gas Gas Gas takes you to a tape's location).","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ghetto-blaster"},{"id":24668,"cover":{"id":17802,"game":24668,"height":1353,"image_id":"ncmrpcudjtaxlbax5j5q","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ncmrpcudjtaxlbax5j5q.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"7dd21139-9316-c818-3792-9f50edd6b0ac"},"first_release_date":473299200,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":40292,"company":{"id":1352,"name":"The Avalon Hill Game Company","slug":"the-avalon-hill-game-company"}}],"name":"Ripper!","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":58129,"category":2,"created_at":1475539200,"date":473299200,"game":24668,"human":"1984","m":12,"platform":15,"region":2,"updated_at":1475539200,"y":1984,"checksum":"b41fc15d-fa42-f880-d12b-ad44713bb119"}],"slug":"ripper--1","summary":"Takes place in 1900 with some famous and fictional characters like Sherlock Holmes, Madame Curie and Florence Nightingale.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ripper--1"},{"id":24666,"cover":{"id":17800,"game":24666,"height":827,"image_id":"asi3ahnlwfmkiu0qfvrk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/asi3ahnlwfmkiu0qfvrk.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"532bfe25-54f2-52c0-17d8-60eb5ab4998b"},"first_release_date":473299200,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":24,"created_at":1300924800,"name":"Tactical","slug":"tactical","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/tactical","checksum":"6132b15f-289e-60ea-5957-7c78b97053a2"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":40290,"company":{"id":6418,"name":"Interphase","slug":"interphase"}}],"name":"Viking Raider","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":58125,"category":2,"created_at":1475539200,"date":473299200,"game":24666,"human":"1984","m":12,"platform":15,"region":2,"updated_at":1475539200,"y":1984,"checksum":"9e60f55e-2d7c-d40a-a382-e8297e053a12"}],"slug":"viking-raider","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/viking-raider"},{"id":67270,"collection":{"id":3417,"created_at":1507507200,"games":[2719,3045,3052,3053,3054,3336,3345,3786,3979,4194,4460,4461,4518,4977,5903,6306,6345,7756,8052,8053,8066,8077,8097,8098,8099,8131,8132,8133,8134,8135,8136,19432,21364,23643,24468,25800,42585,44884,46096,46190,46887,46910,49346,49360,49854,49870,49882,49967,49970,49986,49996,52539,63814,67270,67271,69227,70009,70771,71430,71438,78028],"name":"Looney Tunes","slug":"looney-tunes","updated_at":1507507200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/looney-tunes","checksum":"3aeecbb1-4de9-0bfd-3d72-e56772082400"},"cover":{"id":48851,"game":67270,"height":200,"image_id":"ok6zznw9bmsaxyjcdhq3","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ok6zznw9bmsaxyjcdhq3.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"ce74435f-7228-c7ef-4eb8-9af2c4a8ac97"},"first_release_date":743644800,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":73710,"company":{"id":17711,"name":"Hi-Tec Software Ltd (UK)","slug":"hi-tec-software-ltd-uk"}},{"id":73711,"company":{"id":17712,"name":"P.A.L.

First off you choose a dancer to play out of the four possible options, including the two man team of \"Double Trouble\". Warm up mode allows you to test various dance moves. Moves are triggered by joystick directions and use of the fire button. They range from simple moves such as the moonwalk to more complex maneuvers such as the head spin. There is a decent variety of moves available thanks to the same joystick action doing different moves depending on whether you are standing or doing floor moves. The main game portion gives you a time limit in which to perform your moves and rack up points. An energy bar on the left side of the screen diminishes as you do the more complicated moves. In order to regain some energy you can do a simple move such as uprock or the moon walk. Complex floor moves drain energy quickly. If you are close to running out of energy your character will turn red, warning you to shift to something less strenuous. If the energy bar is completely drained, your performance will be over and your dancer noted as being \"beached out\". It is also possible to fail at a hard move, causing your character to sit and cry on the ground, ending your round.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/break-street"},{"id":40954,"collection":{"id":4964,"created_at":1512864000,"games":[40954],"name":"Fist","slug":"fist","updated_at":1512864000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/fist","checksum":"06bbb1fc-82e1-7c7d-e817-0a6c9adaa32f"},"cover":{"id":55837,"game":40954,"height":382,"image_id":"ygum04htewzk5yxpeclj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ygum04htewzk5yxpeclj.jpg","width":304,"checksum":"c35de147-6943-44ea-898a-9f8c89a32097"},"first_release_date":521337600,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"name":"Fist II: The Legend Continues","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":91676,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":521337600,"game":40954,"human":"Jul 10, 1986","m":7,"platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1986,"checksum":"81069fe4-10de-f5fa-86a9-10187cbc32b2"}],"slug":"fist-ii-the-legend-continues","summary":"The world of Fist II is a sprawling, hostile land of dark swamps and dark forests, of mountains and underground caves.

The creatures though can be killed by dropping a block on top of them or allowing them to fall through the gaps. A bird that occasionally appears can be killed if its flight path is blocked. \n \nTo get the blocks to the bottom of the screen there are platforms over gaps and to get a gap Thorak can walk on the platform to remove it then drop blocks through the gap to the level below.

At a certain level in the cave, Thorak can't get back up so he has to make sure he has two blocks to move to the stream.

All parts must be found within a time limit of 15 minutes in order to complete the game. \n \nThe game is a very basic platformer with rather weired controls. You can only shoot or jump while walking. Moreover, you keep walking in one direction until you press the joystick down, which feels very odd in the beginning and makes the game quite hard to play. \n \nClystron was originally released for the C64 and later ported to the Commodore Amiga.

Their first title \"Stellar 7\" was released before company founding and was later re-released with the Dynamix name on it. They made a number of games for the Commodore 64, among them Project Firestart which was one of the most atmospheric titles for the C64. \n \nIn the following years, Dynamix created a line of action games for Electronic Arts, including one of the first games for the Commodore Amiga, Arcticfox. Later titles were developed for Activision. After self-publishing their games for a short while, in 1990 Dynamix was bought by Sierra On-Line. \n \nOnce part of Sierra, Dynamix created some of their most famous games, including a line of adventures and flight simulations that included Red Baron and The Adventures of Willy Beamish. They also created the puzzle game The Incredible Machine, along with the spinoff Sid & Al's Incredible Toons. Another successful product line was the Front Page Sports series, designed by Pat Cook and Allen McPheeters which included Football, Baseball, and Golf. Versions of Red Baron and Front Page Sports Football were included as part of the ImagiNation Network. \n \nIn 1994, the first game in a new series called Metaltech was released, a giant robot combat game with similarities to the BattleTech universe and games. This series resulted in two Earthsiege games and eventually Starsiege. As a side development of the Starsiege game, the successful Tribes series was created. Dynamix also created Outpost 2: Divided Destiny, the second game in Sierra's strategy/survival franchise, Outpost. \n \nThe Dynamix studio was closed by its parent company Sierra Entertainment on August 14, 2001, as part of Sierra's restructuring under Vivendi Universal. Several veterans of the studio (including Tunnell), however, stayed in Eugene and founded a new studio / electronic publisher, GarageGames. \n \nAfter several years at GarageGames, Dynamix co-founder Jeff Tunnell and long-time Dynamix employee Rick Overman have founded PushButton Labs in Eugene, with the intent to further develop web-based video games. \n \nAfter over 10 years of retirement, Dynamix co-founder and game designer Damon Slye returned to the games industry to start Mad Otter Games in Eugene, Oregon in 2007 alongside several other key ex-Dynamix employees. Mad Otter Games released the online World War II dogfighting game Ace of Aces in 2008 on the web portal InstantAction, though after InstantAction was shut down the company revealed they would be re-releasing the game on their own website (as of August 2012 the game has not been re-released). They are currently developing an online MMORPG called A Mystical Land, which was released in 2011. On October 22, 2013, a Kickstarter campaign was started to fund a re-release of Red Baron.","logo":{"id":395,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":107,"image_id":"zdizcpobh3xsewdewshs","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zdizcpobh3xsewdewshs.jpg","width":324,"checksum":"00c592f5-7fe7-b54a-a83c-1a1a08d4774b"},"name":"Dynamix","slug":"dynamix"}}],"name":"Project Firestart","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":115236,"category":0,"created_at":1506729600,"date":619056000,"game":40941,"human":"Aug 14, 1989","m":8,"platform":15,"region":2,"updated_at":1506729600,"y":1989,"checksum":"2d419302-ab88-80e3-2c5b-e094d53c4410"}],"screenshots":[{"id":376333,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":40941,"height":200,"image_id":"sc82dp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc82dp.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"5af62719-9db3-a2f3-c80e-384145f01698"},{"id":376334,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":40941,"height":500,"image_id":"sc82dq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc82dq.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"813ed309-0491-6057-bb16-41ac23d42a56"},{"id":376335,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":40941,"height":366,"image_id":"sc82dr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc82dr.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"036942bc-3a06-f499-9b56-f34df4a58964"},{"id":376336,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":40941,"height":720,"image_id":"sc82ds","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc82ds.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"744584c2-ad7a-f0f6-4bc2-d217ea27c409"},{"id":376337,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":40941,"height":400,"image_id":"sc82dt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc82dt.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"641c376b-b586-5138-da53-ff95ad403af7"}],"slug":"project-firestart","summary":"In the future (2066) a genetic experiment (Project Firestart) onboard the Prometheus to get strong durable miners went wrong.

If Godzilla reaches Tokyo, the game is over. The game is a large grid on the map of Japan and nearby waters. There are 25 grids (7 of which contain Japan and one containing Tokyo.) Godzilla is randomly set in any of the 25 grids except the grid with Tokyo. The player has a choice of attacking Godzilla or moving troops. You are given a choice of attacking with a land attack, sea attack, air attack, a missile or an atom bomb. When choosing an air, land or sea attack you must choose how many troops, boats or jets you want to send out (you can only send out how many of the given attackers are in the grid that Godzilla is.) You can also move troops and boats to different grids as opposed to attacks. After an attack it will show the amount of attackers killed and how effective the attack was. (e.g. If you send out a sea attack it will tell how many boats were sunk.) After this Godzilla will move to another grid. If Godzilla is on land he will go on a rampage and it will show how many civilians were killed. The atom bomb is the most powerful weapon in the game. Whenever it is used it will destroy all life and weapons around the surrounding 8 squares. If the bomb goes off near Tokyo, the game is over.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/godzilla"},{"id":41007,"cover":{"id":40623,"game":41007,"height":606,"image_id":"be1et1s1qz66b4dyh4qd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/be1et1s1qz66b4dyh4qd.jpg","width":605,"checksum":"ce787de3-edc7-ca03-1f94-dc54a8afb2e6"},"first_release_date":752371200,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":78433,"company":{"id":489,"name":"Mindscape","slug":"mindscape"}}],"name":"Fist Fighter","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":91690,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":752371200,"game":41007,"human":"Nov 04, 1993","m":11,"platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1993,"checksum":"71576f8a-6b2a-c95b-c5fc-cb2f12832cc9"}],"slug":"fist-fighter","summary":"Five fighters have come together to fight in three different locations, Egypt, Japan and America.

The spies must gather the three segments of a rocket and then dive into a sea where a submarine awaits them. However, only connected segments can be carried at any one time.

Find the tomb and you will stand to be the sole beneficiary to Primm’s estate. The only information that you have to go by is Primm’s unpublished paper on the legend of Ahnk-Ahnk and his African diary. \n \nThe quest begins near a large port town and here you can find stores which will allow you to purchase items which are necessary like ropes and shovels. You start the quest with only $250. Use the map provided to find important landmarks and locations which the natives may name when giving you directions. The natives hold the key to your success. Not all natives behave the same to strangers. Offer them gold, copper, or other gifts to win their friendship. But be careful, not all natives see your offering as a sign of friendship. They each have their own cultures. Presenting them with the wrong gift may hinder your attempts to get needed information. \n \nUse the joystick to move about, press the fire button when you are standing still to move control to the four icons to the left of the exploration window. Click these icons for further options. The diary icon lets you page through your diary to review the clues that you get from the native chiefs. The map icon lets you see what you have explored so far. The options icon offers three choices. Two let you check on your location and condition. The third lets you drop things off to form a cache. The hand icon lets you select what you have in your hand and it lets you use items from your backpack. If you are delirious, your joystick control will become uncertain, reversed or randomized. \n \nGo to a pub in a port city to save your game. You can save up to 10 different games at once on a single disk. Each time that you start a new game, the location of the tomb and other valuables is subject to change.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/heart-of-africa"},{"id":72281,"cover":{"id":53601,"game":72281,"height":628,"image_id":"tclaai7eqvnhx3ixkfnr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tclaai7eqvnhx3ixkfnr.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"7d58071f-c85c-3e4b-4365-fe57e99b15d1"},"first_release_date":567907200,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Computer Scrabble De Luxe","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":165199,"category":2,"created_at":1550275200,"date":567907200,"game":72281,"human":"1987","m":12,"platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1550448000,"y":1987,"checksum":"18242b47-445a-c8eb-2e1c-d9f25da7e9c6"}],"slug":"computer-scrabble-de-luxe","summary":"1987, the year Computer Scrabble De Luxe was released on Commodore 64, as well as Amiga, Amstrad CPC and Atari ST.

Hanson and published by Mindscape for the Commodore 64. The game is based on the Indiana Jones series, and was released in North America around January 1985, while a U.K. version was released in March 1985. \n \nGameplay requires the player to think like fictional archaeologist Indiana Jones to solve the puzzles of each level, as the game does not provide the player with any rules or gameplay information; the game's cover advertised, \"Nobody told Indiana Jones the rules. And no one will tell you.\" \n \nIndiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom features six levels played across a \"Lost Kingdom.\" Playing as Indiana Jones, the player must solve a puzzle in each level to progress through the game. The player's ultimate goal is to retrieve a valuable artifact that contains the secrets of a lost civilization, before Jones' arch-rival, Ivar Reiss, can take it for himself. Indiana Jones is armed only with a mystical cane, and must battle against numerous enemies and perils throughout the game, including bats, monsters, steep cliffs, twisting mazes, and \"killer snowflakes\". Joystick movements vary between each level, requiring the player to relearn the control scheme throughout the game. A two-player option is also available. \n \nNo rules or gameplay information is provided to the player, who is left to use logic and intuition to solve each puzzle, as Indiana Jones would. Solving each puzzle requires the player to pay close attention to subtle changes in each level's surroundings or musical score, as well as other possibilities, testing the player's \"Indiana Jones Quotient\" (IJQ). However, the game's instruction manual does feature clues at the bottom of each page. Each clue is presented as a hieroglyphic, and must be deciphered by the player using a magic viewer, similar to 3D glasses. A \"clue hotline\" was also available for players, providing them with pre-recorded hints on how to finish each level.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/indiana-jones-in-the-lost-kingdom"},{"id":47210,"first_release_date":665366400,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"name":"F1 GP Circuits","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":93801,"category":0,"created_at":1500249600,"date":665366400,"game":47210,"human":"Feb 01, 1991","m":2,"platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1500249600,"y":1991,"checksum":"68032e74-faff-e560-8b75-c055cb892d35"}],"slug":"f1-gp-circuits","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/f1-gp-circuits"},{"id":55022,"cover":{"id":29434,"game":55022,"height":827,"image_id":"nh1q2swkrr5mi3pdl7tw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nh1q2swkrr5mi3pdl7tw.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"188def59-3121-64bf-7983-de742d532bcc"},"first_release_date":567907200,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":53355,"company":{"id":11151,"name":"CRL Group PLC","slug":"crl-group-plc"}},{"id":53356,"company":{"id":4503,"name":"Software Invasion","slug":"software-invasion"}}],"name":"Lifeforce","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":109776,"category":2,"created_at":1503273600,"date":567907200,"game":55022,"human":"1987","m":12,"platform":15,"region":1,"updated_at":1503273600,"y":1987,"checksum":"cfff9da8-a8f3-7809-64d8-07a187f4fb95"}],"slug":"lifeforce","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/lifeforce"},{"id":94691,"cover":{"id":91424,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":94691,"height":1074,"image_id":"co1yjk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1yjk.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"bd2161f8-0677-68ed-cec7-9c6814e8ed2b"},"first_release_date":473299200,"involved_companies":[{"id":92335,"company":{"id":11534,"name":"Dale Disharoon, Inc.","slug":"dale-disharoon-inc"}},{"id":92336,"company":{"id":16967,"name":"Spinnaker Software","slug":"spinnaker-software"}}],"name":"Adventure Creator","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":188191,"category":2,"created_at":1581120000,"date":473299200,"game":94691,"human":"1984","m":12,"platform":15,"region":2,"updated_at":1581120000,"y":1984,"checksum":"167273bf-3e28-ce0b-b66f-6162561d501a"}],"slug":"adventure-creator","summary":"Adventure Creator is a fairly simple adventure game creator/editor.

Years have passed with still no solution to the problem and now his subjects who worshipped him have lost patience and are now gathered outside his temple in Memphis. The Pharoh has turned to his wisest man, Imhotep for help but the only solution to be found is for the wise man to find a Princess with the sacred books called the Souls of Ra.

The goal on each level is to eat a set quota of fish whilst avoiding enemy eels, piranhas, sharks and falling anchors. Your mollusk isn't defenseless though - you have a reserve of ink at your disposal! \n \nThe fish stock of each ocean is rapidly depleting - much like in real life - so you'll have to move quick. The stock level reduces when fish leave the screen, so try not to let too many get past you as you zoom about the ocean! When the stock runs out, you'll lose a life. \n \nThe simple HUD on the bottom of the screen functions using both characters and colours. Ink is represented by eight little droplets. These deplete with use and can be recharged by eating jellyfish. Standard ink (grey on the HUD) scares enemies or other fish away and is obtained by eating white jellyfish, whereas poisonous ink (red on the HUD) kills enemies. When you have a reserve of poisonous ink left, any additional ink obtained will also become poisonous. Note that kills achieved using poisonous ink are added towards your fish quota. \n \nYour Mollusk can take two hits from eels or anchors, after which point the lives counter on the HUD will flash red. Another hit will cost you a life, and note that blue eels also slow the Mollusk down. Sharks and piranhas are deadly to touch. \n \nThe fish stock level flashes red and an audible alarm sounds when there are 20 or less fish left in the ocean.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mollusk-redux"},{"id":60225,"cover":{"id":39904,"game":60225,"height":200,"image_id":"wevixlrqnydc2nflkd7x","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wevixlrqnydc2nflkd7x.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"edd5a634-0a7f-6fda-dd3d-95313d8f26c6"},"first_release_date":599529600,"genres":[{"id":26,"created_at":1301961600,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","slug":"quiz-trivia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/quiz-trivia","checksum":"256a99dd-dd06-bc0c-d53b-dc3098da4d49"}],"name":"Super Tact","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":120640,"category":0,"created_at":1508025600,"date":599529600,"game":60225,"human":"Dec 31, 1988","m":12,"platform":15,"region":1,"updated_at":1508025600,"y":1988,"checksum":"d84cc8d3-8777-5e71-f416-414890ca504c"}],"slug":"super-tact","summary":"Implementation of a board game for the Commodore 64 published by The Power House.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-tact"},{"id":13822,"cover":{"id":13994,"game":13822,"height":431,"image_id":"e3rxdz1f3qt8jzwbtmmu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e3rxdz1f3qt8jzwbtmmu.jpg","width":281,"checksum":"cbbb5b46-5d08-44c5-c79f-2a54365fc5ce"},"first_release_date":473299200,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":31532,"company":{"id":8443,"name":"Scorpio Gamesworld","slug":"scorpio-gamesworld"}}],"name":"Bootleg Bandits","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":45327,"category":2,"created_at":1453852800,"date":473299200,"game":13822,"human":"1984","m":12,"platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1453852800,"y":1984,"checksum":"c8cc1223-4550-dd49-fcb6-e7436144a801"}],"screenshots":[{"id":19983,"game":13822,"height":200,"image_id":"qqukgv1yy17xlzqynpga","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qqukgv1yy17xlzqynpga.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"3c108755-f28e-9b66-d154-5ca79bfeac32"},{"id":19984,"game":13822,"height":200,"image_id":"kuijf4hqcnxuhky9hwdl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kuijf4hqcnxuhky9hwdl.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"b15b3224-ba76-183b-ce4d-4e7a0ee01856"},{"id":19985,"game":13822,"height":200,"image_id":"irat1tjhj3v30kqgikwh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/irat1tjhj3v30kqgikwh.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"d9ccf490-14be-46f7-5acb-542dc037c390"},{"id":19986,"game":13822,"height":200,"image_id":"wk08imeinhhj4jz6o1ms","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wk08imeinhhj4jz6o1ms.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"762d8601-2c39-2d59-09e7-5e27e59c2c0d"}],"slug":"bootleg-bandits","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bootleg-bandits"},{"id":119404,"cover":{"id":75174,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":119404,"height":272,"image_id":"co1m06","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1m06.jpg","width":384,"checksum":"0d65703d-d0c5-6a9e-7dce-b5a21489d0a6"},"first_release_date":504835200,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":79942,"company":{"id":2071,"name":"Ariolasoft","slug":"ariolasoft"}}],"name":"Golf Construction Set","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":171206,"category":2,"created_at":1560297600,"date":504835200,"game":119404,"human":"1985","m":12,"platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1560297600,"y":1985,"checksum":"d1fd0fc1-86f5-3e25-0730-725d4d786930"}],"screenshots":[{"id":308012,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":119404,"height":272,"image_id":"sc6lnw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6lnw.jpg","width":384,"checksum":"903c3f9c-acc0-6662-20b6-a9af5815f06e"},{"id":308013,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":119404,"height":272,"image_id":"sc6lnx","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6lnx.jpg","width":384,"checksum":"1d325032-ed2c-6a7c-adcc-c6197d3939ba"},{"id":308014,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":119404,"height":272,"image_id":"sc6lny","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6lny.jpg","width":384,"checksum":"f3260a3b-57a8-f48d-496e-6607110057ad"}],"slug":"golf-construction-set","summary":"One to four players can compete in Match or Tournament Play, with individual handicaps.

Following the AD&D rules of role-playing, the player creates a party of characters (up to the maximum of six). Exploration takes place in pseudo-3D environments, from first-person view. Battles (random as well as pre-set) take the player-controlled and enemy party to a top-down battle screen. Commands are issued in turn-based fashion, and the player-controlled characters can freely navigate the battle field. Unlike the previous games, there is no \"world map\" traveling in Secret of the Silver Blades.

At the beginning of each stage, the aliens begin to drop from the sky. Your goal is to cruise around in your plane and to shoot them, preferably before they descend on a building, because then they will begin to crush it until it is destroyed completely. Once you have disposed of such an alien wave, you enter the next stage, with tougher and more numerous foes. Your plane might run out of fuel; in this case, you must pick up fuel left by friendly planes who appear sometimes on the screen. Often an alien will lay an egg on the ground, and a newly born baby will immediately begin to destroy the buildings from below. To prevent this, you will have to leave your craft, enter the dangerous subway tunnels, and dispose of the young alien using your handgun.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/save-new-york"},{"id":74071,"collection":{"id":4226,"created_at":1510617600,"games":[40971,74071],"name":"Cavelon","slug":"cavelon","updated_at":1510617600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/cavelon","checksum":"d3aff2d7-5a5a-1535-a9d7-1963e9f678c0"},"cover":{"id":44528,"game":74071,"height":1567,"image_id":"vurvpbvpdobamaw0c7nd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vurvpbvpdobamaw0c7nd.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"825c2a45-7e5d-00e1-ebb7-9189def11972"},"first_release_date":473299200,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":57977,"company":{"id":13873,"name":"Jetsoft","slug":"jetsoft"}}],"name":"Cavelon II","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":128302,"category":2,"created_at":1510617600,"date":473299200,"game":74071,"human":"1984","m":12,"platform":15,"region":2,"updated_at":1510617600,"y":1984,"checksum":"a2535ceb-029e-9c2e-ed13-19368b8c4b76"}],"slug":"cavelon-ii","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/cavelon-ii"},{"id":25718,"cover":{"id":18644,"game":25718,"height":1558,"image_id":"p3sp9xemv8eralza4krh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p3sp9xemv8eralza4krh.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"ae27527f-cb7c-176c-dad9-37425ce456e5"},"first_release_date":441676800,"genres":[{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":41464,"company":{"id":8108,"name":"Virgin Games Ltd.","slug":"virgin-games-ltd"}}],"name":"Hideous Bill and the Gi-Gants","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":60201,"category":2,"created_at":1478822400,"date":441676800,"game":25718,"human":"1983","m":12,"platform":15,"region":1,"updated_at":1478822400,"y":1983,"checksum":"b51f49a3-153c-c393-2b02-a48aa23283d4"}],"slug":"hideous-bill-and-the-gi-gants--1","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hideous-bill-and-the-gi-gants--1"},{"id":36654,"cover":{"id":24312,"game":36654,"height":1551,"image_id":"gm3z50ek0vrqf9an3zmx","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gm3z50ek0vrqf9an3zmx.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"35f344bd-a3fa-0e48-a190-1776f798726f"},"first_release_date":473299200,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":49431,"company":{"id":11506,"name":"Anirog Software Ltd.","slug":"anirog-software-ltd"}}],"name":"Zaga Mission","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":79512,"category":2,"created_at":1496361600,"date":473299200,"game":36654,"human":"1984","m":12,"platform":15,"region":1,"updated_at":1496361600,"y":1984,"checksum":"49b0272b-d74a-89be-7744-e3a57e9f39d1"}],"slug":"zaga-mission","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/zaga-mission"},{"id":109041,"cover":{"id":72075,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":109041,"height":200,"image_id":"co1jm3","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1jm3.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"9e4fd5cd-8de0-6db5-fd98-8005e71db498"},"first_release_date":441676800,"genres":[{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"name":"Maggotmania","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":166127,"category":2,"created_at":1552003200,"date":441676800,"game":109041,"human":"1983","m":12,"platform":15,"region":8,"updated_at":1552089600,"y":1983,"checksum":"3249ea92-68a7-0a32-29aa-58085f7d0f7a"}],"screenshots":[{"id":291264,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":109041,"height":200,"image_id":"sc68qo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc68qo.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"7a2a28ab-8612-84f8-52cc-dde4ea568cc5"},{"id":291265,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":109041,"height":200,"image_id":"sc68qp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc68qp.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"56f8f6f9-f99b-9d2f-3df0-d3f2c0b8ed7c"}],"slug":"maggotmania","summary":"Maggotmania is a single screen shooter inspired by the arcade game Centipede where you control a blue creature at the bottom of the screen trying to destroy a large maggot that appears at the top of the screen over various levels.

The goal is to pick up friendly robots while blasting enemies. Once a robot is picked up he can be taken back to base and dropped. \n \nIn Orbit: Flying about Earth in another two-way horizontal scrolling game, the player has to blast enemy ships while trying to load supplies in orbit over the planet. The game then switches to a 3D view behind the player's ship as it heads for the loading bay. \n \nFinal Tournament: Reminiscent of the first game, this part is a competition in three events of armed combat: Jet Joust, Light Sabres and Photon Chains. Each event is viewed from the side on a single screen. The goal is to defeat one's opponent and get a high score.

It takes place in a maze, but it's not a symmetric battle: the player is faster than the enemy, but the enemy can go through walls and fire faster than the player can. \n \nWizard was innovative in several ways. There was no need to aim, as the angle of the player's fire was automatically sent in the direction of the player's enemy. The enemy remained invisible when it was behind a wall, making it one of the first games to implement a line-of-sight algorithm. It also had a very realistic (for the time) heart beat, which would become louder as the player got closer to the enemy.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wizard"},{"id":26273,"cover":{"id":19354,"game":26273,"height":1532,"image_id":"ygual1sh5gczsj23xyly","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ygual1sh5gczsj23xyly.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"78c2fd25-6de5-e0a9-991c-255fdddcfa0c"},"first_release_date":504835200,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":42502,"company":{"id":2071,"name":"Ariolasoft","slug":"ariolasoft"}},{"id":42503,"company":{"id":4126,"name":"Andromeda Software","slug":"andromeda-software"}}],"name":"Scarabaeus","platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"id":62039,"category":2,"created_at":1481068800,"date":504835200,"game":26273,"human":"1985","m":12,"platform":15,"region":1,"updated_at":1481068800,"y":1985,"checksum":"a5409b0b-49e9-77cb-90f8-dab4df4e5ccc"}],"slug":"scarabaeus","summary":"Scarabæus is a 3D adventure game made by Andromeda in 1985.

Gribbly Grobbly is your typical Blabgorian, and is tasked with the safety of the 'gribblets'. 'Gribblets' are infant Blabgorians; they have an armoured shell to protect them, but when flipped on their backs they expose their vulnerable belly and are unable to right themselves. They also have an annoying tendency to leave the safety of home in search of adventure. Unfortunately Blabgor is not a safe place; there are hordes of beasts roaming the landscape, eagerly searching for vulnerable Gribblets. \n \nThe basic premise for the game required the player to control Gribbly and navigate him through each of the 16 surreal 8-way scrolling landscapes in an attempt to locate and rescue eight baby Gribblets and returning them to the safety of the home cave. Gribbly can hop and levitate around each of the levels and can blow bubbles to defend himself. Once a Gribblet is located, Gribbly can pick up the hapless offspring and carry it to safety. Once only a single Gribblet remains on a level, the energy web fails, freeing Seon. This usually results in a mad rush to get the remaining Gribblet to safety before succumbing to his attacks. Once all the Gribblets are either saved or killed, the level ends and Gribbly is transported to the next level.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gribblys-day-out"}]}
