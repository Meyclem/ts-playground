The battles are fought linearly in any order, and after each boss is defeated, a special weapon is added to the player's arsenal. Each boss is weak to one specific weapon, so the player is encouraged to strategize the order in which the bosses are faced.

While you paint, two enemies walk around in the maze, when they hit you, you lose a life. \n \nA level has rollers which you can push forward with your paint brush. If you capture an enemy in the path of the roller he dies and is temporarily taken out of the game. This scores you extra points. Each subsequent enemy rolled over is worth more points. \n \nEvery once in a while another creature will pop up, it will run around leaving behind track marks in your paint. Painting over this creature removes it from the game and scores you additional points. His tracks have to be repainted. \n \nWhen the entire maze is painted you win the level. Unlike the original arcade version the Neo Geo Pocket Color version has multiple levels.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/crush-roller--1"},{"id":43968,"cover":{"id":44177,"game":43968,"height":592,"image_id":"rnlnlnmchfabwq05gwm4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rnlnlnmchfabwq05gwm4.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"3c3d7e5a-2ad9-6bc2-ffce-eebf3a2e6faf"},"first_release_date":915148800,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":57242,"company":{"id":13783,"name":"DYNA","slug":"dyna"}}],"name":"Neo Derby Champ Daiyosou","platforms":[120],"release_dates":[{"id":92364,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":927331200,"game":43968,"human":"May 22, 1999","m":5,"platform":120,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1999,"checksum":"5f07b0df-4a44-77f9-1a83-3a6e6c8f0b9e"},{"id":127067,"category":0,"created_at":1509926400,"date":915148800,"game":43968,"human":"Jan 01, 1999","m":1,"platform":120,"region":5,"updated_at":1509926400,"y":1999,"checksum":"901fa55c-76a8-1e1c-eb69-375b534ab88d"}],"slug":"neo-derby-champ-daiyosou","summary":"Neo Derby Champ Daiyosou is a Sports game, developed and published by Dyna Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1999.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/neo-derby-champ-daiyosou"},{"id":43995,"cover":{"id":26642,"game":43995,"height":1500,"image_id":"iwshywlayaqtbnpxvfhi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iwshywlayaqtbnpxvfhi.jpg","width":1500,"checksum":"3b04d15b-dc86-4b47-a75d-84bf6676f5c3"},"first_release_date":945302400,"name":"Sore Ike!!

Eternal Dungeons is a conventional turn-based role-playing video game for the Neo Geo Pocket Color. It was released in Japan and the United Kingdom in 2000.

While the Japanese version is somewhat common, the English version is not. \n \nThis game is essentially a port of its three dimensional counterpart for the Dreamcast. To accommodate downscaling for the Neo Geo handheld, the 3D graphics of the original were replaced with top-down two-dimensional maps and 2-D sprites. \n \nBoth the Japanese and UK version of the game were released in hard plastic boxes rather than soft cardstock. \n \nThe English translation has frequent grammar and spelling errors.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/evolution-eternal-dungeons"},{"id":43988,"collection":{"id":854,"created_at":1396569600,"games":[4361,5884,5896,5897,7036,7038,12588,15326,15426,15427,15428,15429,15430,15431,15432,15433,15434,15435,18814,22679,22952,26802,43348,43832,43841,43988,47602,49169,49170,61195,63832,70518,76968,78379,79083,80562,80566,80567,80568,80866,83931,113104],"name":"The King of Fighters","slug":"the-king-of-fighters","updated_at":1396569600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/the-king-of-fighters","checksum":"7bd2e1f1-18e1-0ec2-7362-516b44683419"},"cover":{"id":69451,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":43988,"height":787,"image_id":"co1hl7","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1hl7.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"c7aa6b80-ac5d-a4e8-cdfc-d73188d603a9"},"first_release_date":915148800,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":57218,"company":{"id":1474,"name":"SNK","slug":"snk"}}],"name":"King of Fighters R-2","platforms":[120],"release_dates":[{"id":92339,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":924480000,"game":43988,"human":"Apr 19, 1999","m":4,"platform":120,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1999,"checksum":"76228d60-770c-e231-95c7-c2a0da94d0d6"},{"id":126947,"category":0,"created_at":1509926400,"date":915148800,"game":43988,"human":"Jan 01, 1999","m":1,"platform":120,"region":1,"updated_at":1509926400,"y":1999,"checksum":"1c81d555-50d3-5249-ce56-0315b76957de"},{"id":126948,"category":0,"created_at":1509926400,"date":915148800,"game":43988,"human":"Jan 01, 1999","m":1,"platform":120,"region":5,"updated_at":1509926400,"y":1999,"checksum":"d8e79d65-9c1a-9713-9abe-d70d9743e337"},{"id":126949,"category":0,"created_at":1509926400,"date":915148800,"game":43988,"human":"Jan 01, 1999","m":1,"platform":120,"region":2,"updated_at":1509926400,"y":1999,"checksum":"dc6922af-1a2d-9cab-7026-4c44d3028d65"}],"slug":"king-of-fighters-r-2","summary":"Mix it up in COLOR with King Of Fighters R-2 now on NEOGEO Pocket Color!

The amount of actions they can input is dependant on their type of TS. Once they have finished their selection everything is played out in real-time for the duration of the turn.

This is accomplished by choosing the right options when they are presented to you. If you succeed in focusing on only one girl, her CG is then unlocked in the gallery.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-real-mahjong-premium-collection"},{"id":43967,"collection":{"id":4532,"created_at":1512777600,"games":[6728,43967],"name":"Cool Cool Toon","slug":"cool-cool-toon","updated_at":1512777600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/cool-cool-toon","checksum":"c1022106-7e9c-c53c-6dee-2e807c3025ed"},"cover":{"id":44097,"game":43967,"height":605,"image_id":"vzsyrrqpxzshiou0efac","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vzsyrrqpxzshiou0efac.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"31984b54-ad0e-1b6b-bfec-3d2f8f790f9b"},"first_release_date":946684800,"genres":[{"id":7,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Music","slug":"music","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/music","checksum":"22d44a0d-89c7-580f-eef2-e06f178fdd47"}],"name":"Cool Cool Jam","platforms":[120],"release_dates":[{"id":92365,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":968544000,"game":43967,"human":"Sep 10, 2000","m":9,"platform":120,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":2000,"checksum":"db0a631d-bd8f-6cb2-0c27-245293b83bc3"},{"id":126664,"category":0,"created_at":1509926400,"date":946684800,"game":43967,"human":"Jan 01, 2000","m":1,"platform":120,"region":5,"updated_at":1509926400,"y":2000,"checksum":"a2f62916-b5e6-ec60-f430-4ad432e7785b"}],"slug":"cool-cool-jam","summary":"Cool Cool Jam is comparable in gameplay to other rhythm games such as: PaRappa the Rapper, Donkey Konga or Beatmania. \n \nThe storyline involves a boy and a girl who are transported 1,000 years into the future.

It also re-added two series favorites who were not in the arcade, Charlotte and Yagyu Jubei.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/samurai-shodown-2"},{"id":75442,"cover":{"id":44081,"game":75442,"height":586,"image_id":"aqi65kpqwg66ysnzpgun","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aqi65kpqwg66ysnzpgun.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"1b217b67-3ebe-47b9-e219-9f233198c5c0"},"first_release_date":946684800,"name":"SNK vs Capcom Cardfighters Clash Capcom Supporters Edition (Best Collection)","platforms":[120],"release_dates":[{"id":126584,"category":0,"created_at":1509926400,"date":946684800,"game":75442,"human":"Jan 01, 2000","m":1,"platform":120,"region":5,"updated_at":1509926400,"y":2000,"checksum":"cc384fd1-775a-9d11-c206-309064a049dc"}],"slug":"snk-vs-capcom-cardfighters-clash-capcom-supporters-edition-best-collection","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/snk-vs-capcom-cardfighters-clash-capcom-supporters-edition-best-collection"},{"id":55058,"collection":{"id":2755,"created_at":1496534400,"games":[22049,55058],"name":"Capcom vs. SNK","slug":"capcom-vs-snk","updated_at":1496534400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/capcom-vs-snk","checksum":"ad0b44f5-7d07-b0b2-b3d0-713e3124c1e8"},"cover":{"id":91199,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":55058,"height":800,"image_id":"co1ydb","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ydb.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"4ba79690-f7b0-4e53-9efe-e0455027ba34"},"first_release_date":943920000,"franchises":[{"id":636,"created_at":1442361600,"games":[3846,6184,12588,15434,21387,22049,39593,45829,51692,55058,80568,83931,86343,99496,102809,106763,115445,117502,119415],"name":"The King of Fighters","slug":"the-king-of-fighters","updated_at":1442361600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/the-king-of-fighters","checksum":"fa71c848-37c4-4892-8dec-dd48e9381d02"},{"id":792,"created_at":1459728000,"games":[884,1065,1239,2066,2275,3186,3846,4238,5766,6178,6184,6656,6702,6703,6704,6708,6709,6710,6864,6895,6930,7198,8244,8245,8246,8247,8248,8258,9721,11595,12860,14536,18626,19754,20586,20803,20878,21387,21724,21796,22049,22221,26773,28398,38297,39314,39318,39319,39496,39593,41828,42876,43666,44276,44965,45184,45192,45194,45195,45196,45198,45829,53342,53678,55037,55058,55059,55060,55061,55062,55063,55064,55065,55280,74155,75374,86343,89877,99551,115992,120484,126095,126269,128866,134337],"name":"Street Fighter","slug":"street-fighter","updated_at":1459728000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/street-fighter","checksum":"35e32de0-ead1-c622-6109-65a08c4b57cb"}],"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"name":"SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium","platforms":[120],"release_dates":[{"id":110297,"category":0,"created_at":1503532800,"date":943920000,"game":55058,"human":"Nov 30, 1999","m":11,"platform":120,"region":2,"updated_at":1503532800,"y":1999,"checksum":"76ade843-ff35-e17c-c96b-1e843b23892a"}],"slug":"snk-vs-capcom-the-match-of-the-millennium","summary":"With 18 starting characters (26 total after unlocking), numerous battle modes and varied minigames, this may be the largest fighting game for the Neo Geo Pocket Color.
