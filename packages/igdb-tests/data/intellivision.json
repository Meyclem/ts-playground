Programmer Ron Surratt (Atari 2600 BurgerTime) and graphic artist Peggi Decarli (USCF Chess) drew up some initial concepts for the game (Ron's input was requested because he used to be a teacher), then Steve Ettinger was assigned as programmer. New-hire Joe Ferreira was added to train with Peggi as a graphics artist. Steve and Joe quickly became a strong design team, taking the concept from a barnyard to a carousel and making the game their own. By the time it was finished, however, Marketing decided that sales of Intellivoice units were too low to support such a \"specialty\" cartridge. Magic Carousel was shelved with the hope that a future increase in Intellivoice sales would justify the game's release. It never happened. \n \nSteve and Joe had proved themselves to be a formidable team, so they were chosen to design the top-secret experimental Intellivision game, Hover Force 3-D. \n \nEASTER EGG: Connect the twinkling stars above the carousel on the title screen to get SEE and JAF, Steve and Joe's initials.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/magic-carousel"},{"id":41448,"cover":{"id":79677,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":41448,"height":830,"image_id":"co1ph9","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ph9.jpg","width":623,"checksum":"edfa5136-0e07-f3db-1b4a-144bf85fc214"},"first_release_date":409449600,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"USCF Chess","platforms":[67],"release_dates":[{"id":91982,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":409449600,"game":41448,"human":"Dec 23, 1982","m":12,"platform":67,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1982,"checksum":"7b354b83-c686-0ca4-b629-b182639b602c"}],"slug":"uscf-chess","summary":"Game features include taking back and redoing moves, rotating the game board 180 degrees, and setting up the chess board for special moves and instances.

This began his lifelong fascination with video games and computers. Even though the family had an Atari 2600, Ryan and his brothers were drawn to the Intellivision and its more complex games. \n \nBy 1992, the family Intellivision had long since died, but Ryan started to discover that thrift stores and garage sales were loaded with old video games. For little money, he was able to build what a decade earlier would've been the video game collection of any kid's dreams. Ryan had become an Intellivision fanatic again. \n \nAs we rolled into the new millennium, the feasibility of programming the Intellivision became possible. A handful of individuals managed to create compilers, emulators, documentation, and development hardware of the Intellivision. Ryan's attention was peaked in 2000 when Joe Zbiciak programmed an entirely new game, 4-Tris, and then managed to build and sell it as a complete package. \n \nIn 2002 Ryan found a lot of spare time to start dabbling with Intellivision programming. After experimenting with a variety of \"Hello World\" programs and learning the various features of the Intellivision one by one, Ryan adopted a Minesweeper clone as the theme of his first full game attempt. \n \nRyan chose to do MineHunter for the following reasons: \n \n1) MineHunter is a proven concept. Creating an entirely new game concept is always a risky venture and requires a greater investment of time. (This is why you see so many clones of popular games.) \n \n2) MineHunter is not very difficult to program since it requires little or no animation. (This belief changed when Ryan added the explosion routine.) \n \n3) The game concept had always been a favorite of him. Every time he came across it, he would find himself addicted again. \n \n4) MineHunter is well suited for the Intellivision's display capabilities. MindStrike for the Intellivision ECS proved that it's feasible to make a screen full of numbers look good. \n \n \nThe majority of MineHunter was programmed over the course of about 9 months from mid 2002 to early 2003. The game was about 95% finished when suddenly all of Ryan's free time had disappeared. In addition, his interest in programming the Intellivision was starting to wane due to realization that it may be impossible to ever build and sell games. Some brief research showed Ryan that building actual cartridges and producing the associated manuals, boxes, and overlays would be insanely expensive and require an immense amount of time. \n \nRyan's Intellivision programming work was falling farther and farther to the backburner when in late 2003 he was approached by the Chris Neiman and David Harley about the possibility of making MineHunter into an actual cartridge. Over 2003 and 2004 they put a lot of effort, research and investment into working out a plan that would allow for the production of new games to be published just like the originals were 20 years ago. Their efforts encouraged him to complete the programming of MineHunter in 2004.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/minehunter"},{"id":41435,"cover":{"id":79701,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":41435,"height":585,"image_id":"co1phx","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1phx.jpg","width":439,"checksum":"29f918a1-074a-eefd-fba8-1db37bafdef3"},"first_release_date":344822400,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"name":"The Electric Company Word Fun","platforms":[67],"release_dates":[{"id":91963,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":344822400,"game":41435,"human":"Dec 05, 1980","m":12,"platform":67,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1980,"checksum":"6b3e7d59-db44-c08e-daf1-cce54c8fcc58"}],"slug":"the-electric-company-word-fun","summary":"Word Fun was developed in conjuction with the Children's Television Workshop, and features three different word based educational games.

You can also steal bases and kick up a cloud of dust as you slide into the bag. Nine innings of action-packed fun, for one or two players. Play ball! \n \nDuring 1981, APh started work on Baseball II and Basketball II -- one-player versions of the original games. These were not high priorities since the original versions continued to sell well. In 1982, when the Keyboard Component was killed, Marketing wanted to produce a series of Super Sports cartridges for the Entertainment Computer System (ECS) to help push that system, so work was ordered halted on the non-ECS sports games. \n \nFUN FACT: INTV Corporation released the game as is, including the fatal bug and the debugging module. The game occasionally crashes, displaying the debugging screen. To explain this, INTV added the following notice to the instruction book: \n \nBaseball II, however, was a favorite of baseball-fanatic Mike Minkoff (Snafu). The game had been essentially completed, but regularly crashed, despite weeks of debugging at APh. Mattel didn't want to put any more resources into the game, but Mike, although now a Director in charge of Intellivision, Aquarius and M Network development, volunteered to debug the game himself after hours. Since the game had already been announced in several catalogs and press releases (as All-Star Major League Baseball), Mattel kept the title on the schedule and let Mike work on it, on and off as he had time, throughout 1983. \n \nMike managed to clean most of the bugs out of the game, but the cause of one occasional crash eluded him. He linked in a debugging module written by Rick Koenig (Motocross) that displayed the contents of registers and status words on screen when a game halted. Mike was still trying to trace the problem when, in January 1984, Mattel Electronics was closed. \n \nINTV Corporation ultimately released the game; it first appears in their Spring 1986 catalog. They were able to use packaging and instructions already completed for the game at Mattel, with the change of the name to World Championship Baseball so that they wouldn't have to pay for the Major League trademark.

Each player controls an array of forces with the objective of capturing or destroying his opponent's \"flag.\" \n  \nPRODUCTION HISTORY \nThis wargame simulation took a long time in programming (officially 391 days, compared to 170 days for Night Stalker, begun at about the same time); when completed in mid-1982, Marketing was concerned that its design already looked dated. \n \nA second concern was that, due to the complexity of the game, it required more memory than an Intellivision contained; the cartridge would have to include 256 bytes of RAM onboard. Only USCF Chess had been approved for onboard RAM, an expensive proposition. \n \nWhen the Entertainment Computer System (ECS) was given the green light, Gabriel Baum, VP of Applications Software, proposed changing Land Battle to an ECS title; the ECS had an additional 2K of RAM available for cartridges. Marketing resisted this -- they still wanted Land Battle as a stand-alone game. Peggi Decarli was assigned to give the game a graphics makeover. \n \nAfter the makeover, Marketing still didn't find it visually interesting enough. By that time, wargame fanatic Steve Sents, having completed Deadly Discs, had started work on an ECS wargame called Desert Fox, which Marketing liked the looks of better. The decision was made to kill Land Battle and incorporate as much of its gameplay and programming as possible into the Desert Fox design.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/land-battle"},{"id":5685,"cover":{"id":79742,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":5685,"height":524,"image_id":"co1pj2","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1pj2.jpg","width":377,"checksum":"44c0ccbe-5d23-dd81-e146-89219a80769c"},"first_release_date":599529600,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":13696,"company":{"id":1312,"name":"Realtime Associates","slug":"realtime-associates"}},{"id":13697,"company":{"id":2524,"name":"INTV Corporation","slug":"intv-corporation"}}],"name":"Mountain Madness: Super Pro Skiing","platforms":[67],"release_dates":[{"id":13904,"category":2,"created_at":1396137600,"date":599529600,"game":5685,"human":"1988","m":12,"platform":67,"region":8,"updated_at":1396137600,"y":1988,"checksum":"6044042e-0d9b-f3f7-f7c2-f1a686666788"}],"slug":"mountain-madness-super-pro-skiing","summary":"An update of U.S. Ski Team Skiing, Mountain Madness: Super Pro Skiing includes code from that game, but offers new features such as enhanced graphics, create-your-own course, and random skiing, which has a helicopter dropping players off on uncharted mountains.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mountain-madness-super-pro-skiing"},{"id":41446,"cover":{"id":79684,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":41446,"height":1131,"image_id":"co1phg","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1phg.jpg","width":848,"checksum":"de1626c1-ebf3-93f6-c427-b69a8d62db63"},"first_release_date":412905600,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"name":"Worm Whomper","platforms":[67],"release_dates":[{"id":91984,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":412905600,"game":41446,"human":"Feb 01, 1983","m":2,"platform":67,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1983,"checksum":"57d18fae-b8a0-3e79-1f8c-05638115ac82"}],"slug":"worm-whomper","summary":"Felton Pinkerton wanted to take his wife to the fair, so he didn't get a chance to spray pesticide on his crop of corn.

Once a destination is set, you need to stock your plane with bombs and fuel, then take off! You will now have a first person point of view from the plane and can control which of several views is active. When trying to bomb targets, you will be looking straight down from the bombay doors. When you hear a voice announce incoming enemy planes, you need to switch the view to one of the guns and defend yourself. Lastly you can have a view from the cockpit to control the plane.

The winner is the surviving serpent.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/snafu"},{"id":5695,"collection":{"id":3416,"created_at":1507507200,"games":[5695,22649,50770,63815,65434,76457,79380,79381],"name":"Digital Combat Simulator","slug":"digital-combat-simulator","updated_at":1507507200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/digital-combat-simulator","checksum":"1e35d402-c232-4601-3bca-dee5b4b1d0ec"},"cover":{"id":79650,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":5695,"height":1547,"image_id":"co1pgi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1pgi.jpg","width":1160,"checksum":"5c33eb14-2ca9-35d4-7b82-72baddefd549"},"first_release_date":410140800,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":13709,"company":{"id":2521,"name":"Mattel Electronics","slug":"mattel-electronics"}}],"name":"Shark!
