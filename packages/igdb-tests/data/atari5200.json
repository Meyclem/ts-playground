By 1982, Atari game programmers realized that they were severely limited by the capabilities of the 2600 system.\n\nThe designers incorporated technology into the 5200 (called \"Pam\" in developmental stages) which they had just developed for their own 8-bit 400 and 800 series personal computer systems. The 5200 is basically a game console version of their home computer, substituting a controller in place of a keyboard.\n\nThe Intellivision system had raised the stakes in the gaming industry with its 16-position controller. Atari's own 2600 offered only 8 positions. In hopes of obliterating the competition, Atari designer, Craig Asher helped engineer the \"analog\" controller. It gives players full, 360° control of the action on-screen.\n\nThe 5200 controller contains two other features which made Atari's unique to any other system built by 1982: First, It offers speed variability. When a joystick is held in a single direction long enough, a player can increase his or her rate of on-screen movement. Second, it contains an easy-access PAUSE button, enabling players to easily freeze their games indefinitely. This immediately became a normal feature on most every subsequent system controller.\n\nUnfortunately there turned out to be a major drawback to this groundbreaking technology. The analog controllers never caught on with consumers because they are \"non-centering,\" meaning they do not feature a neutral position. There is no way to come to an immediate stop. This factor will tend to inflict a high level of frustration on any 5200 player who tackles a game which requires precision stopping and starting movements like Frogger or Pac-Man. The controllers were also apparently not made with durability in mind and are quite easily broken.\n\nWhen Atari released the 5200 it was incompatible with 2600 cartridges. Consumers who had loaded up on games for the 2600 were understandably reluctant to invest in an entirely new platform. Its initial retail price of $330 didn't cause units to fly off of the shelves either.\n\nThe 5200 also improved on the 2600 in its switch box. The 2600 system requires players to walk behind the television and change the setting on the box setting from TV to GAME. The 5200 automatically switches to GAME after the power is turned on. Also, when changing cartridges, the 5200 shifts to a black screen instead of the annoying, white noisy static players get between games with the 2600.\n\nWhen the platform was launched in 1982, Atari chose not to support it with any \"must have\" new titles. Instead they decided to re-release improved versions of former best seller for the 2600 like Space Invaders or Galaxian. Later, they did offer more sought-after titles like Joust, Space Dungeon and Ms. Pac-Man, but by that time the gaming market was on the verge of collapse.\n\nIn 1983, between: Atari (with the 5200 and 2600), ColecoVision and Intellivision, the VCS (Video Computer System) market was stuck in a glut due to an oversaturation of product. Consumers were also demanding that their computers perform more functions than just play games. At that point the Commodore 64 and Atari 800XL home computers had just been released.\n\nEven after a slow start, 1983 sales for the 5200 plummeted. Warner Communications (Atari's former parent company) reported second quarter losses of $283.4 million. By the end of the year, Atari had posted losses of $536 million. They ended production of the 5200 in 1984.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/platforms/atari5200/version/initial-version-e61f84a7-2907-4d65-af7d-4edf75c34dd7","checksum":"5a305c21-915f-5a36-8488-ee6ed6256025"}],"checksum":"13273bf7-63ca-8a0f-2b70-0891d4284e2e","games":[{"id":14706,"cover":{"id":23476,"game":14706,"height":2100,"image_id":"b5tdx5ktm08nt24hdvcx","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b5tdx5ktm08nt24hdvcx.jpg","width":1544,"checksum":"faf78ad3-349e-9535-2a8e-e459ed4467c7"},"first_release_date":1075593600,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"name":"Beef Drop","platforms":[66],"release_dates":[{"id":91602,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":1075593600,"game":14706,"human":"Feb 01, 2004","m":2,"platform":66,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":2004,"checksum":"f80943ed-4b62-c601-7585-91bc2e71de4b"}],"slug":"beef-drop","summary":"Beef Drop is a port of the popular arcade game Burgertime, which Ken Siders first ported to the Atari 5200 and 8-bit computers.

You take control of goofy as he competes in two events, the Marathon Dive and the Pogo Pop. \n \nThe Marathon Dive is a game in which you must guide Goofy up a series of platforms so he can reach the diving platform and jump off before the timer runs out. As Goofy climbs up the platforms he must avoid little armored tanks, which will chase Goofy around. Thankfully these tanks can't jump, reverse direction, or use the ladders, so they can be avoided by jumping over them or leading them into a hole (which will cause them to fall down to the next level). Also hindering Goofy's progress are large gaps in the platforms which must be carefully jumped over. If Goofy falls through a hole he'll fall down one level but is otherwise unharmed, however if he is hit by a tank he'll loose a life. \n \nIf Goofy makes it to the top of the platform he will run off the end, making it about halfway across the screen before realizing that he's running in mid-air. Now Goofy will begin to fall, and you must guide him down to the little floating platform below. However the floating platform is constantly moving in an erratic fashion, so hitting it can be tough. If you successfully reach the platform, Goofy will smash into it and have his parachute open a second too late (in typical cartoon fashion). If you miss the platform Goofy will fall into the water and drown (I guess he doesn't know how to swim). As the levels progress the tanks will begin to move faster and faster, the diving platform has more holes in it, and the floating platform moves more erratically. Eventually the difficulty will wrap around however, and the game will get very easy again. \n \nPogo Pop takes place on a series of squares where Goofy bounces up and down on a pogo stick in an effort to touch every tile. This may sound easy but there's a catch, every time you jump one of the tiles disappears, so the tile that was below you may not be there when you land. As the levels progress the frequency of the tiles disappearing increases, making it harder and harder not to fall through the floor.  \n \nWhile you're jumping on tiles you can attempt to pop the Mickey Mouse balloons floating above you for extra points. The balloons come in several different colors and are worth a varying amount of points.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sports-goofy"},{"id":12306,"cover":{"id":16958,"game":12306,"height":1361,"image_id":"e5tuvmt4cq8bcucbaecy","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e5tuvmt4cq8bcucbaecy.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"eb18b12d-fbf1-38c9-fe19-7712e779b859"},"first_release_date":410140800,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":38946,"company":{"id":82,"logo":{"id":1568,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":160,"image_id":"b0bv0naux50nfsas5yht","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b0bv0naux50nfsas5yht.jpg","width":146,"checksum":"6f6f16c0-1219-05c4-da15-8782af311b60"},"name":"Atari","slug":"atari"}}],"name":"Countermeasure","platforms":[66],"release_dates":[{"id":55710,"category":2,"created_at":1472342400,"date":410140800,"game":12306,"human":"1982","m":12,"platform":66,"region":2,"updated_at":1472342400,"y":1982,"checksum":"5204efb3-eb83-978c-4b84-71e22a10ea03"}],"slug":"countermeasure","summary":"We've just received word that terrorists have seized one of our missile silo complexes and are threatening to blow up Washington, D.C. These lunatics aren't fooling! \n \nThey've wired the missiles to a silo computer and started the launch sequence timer. In just 10 minutes the missiles will lift off for Washington... unless YOU stop them. Destroy all the silos in the complex with your long-range turret gun before the timer runs out. If you complete this mission, you'll win the Congressional Medal of Honor... along with 10,000 bonus points and a bonus life. \n \nIf the timer runs out before you destroy all the silos, you still have a chance to prevent disaster. In the seconds before impact, dock your supertank at a silo, enter the War Room, and guess the fail-safe code that disarms the missiles: The code is some combination of the letters L, E, and O... for example, ELL, OOO, or OLE. Succeed and you win 10,000 bonus points and a bonus life.

Castle Blast is Ronen Habot's first foray into programming the Atari 5200. Ronen used this experience as a means to write a tutorial on Atari 5200 programming to assist others who might want to write games for the system. \n \nCastle Blast made its debut at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo, where it was sold with a box, manual and cart. AtariAge held a Castle Blast Label Contest in April, 2002. Castle Blast may be ordered directly from the author, Ronen Habot, by visiting the Castle Blast Development Page. \n \nThe object of this game is to destroy the Castle on the Mothership. You fire Vertical Trajectory Missiles, or VTMs, at the shield on the bottom of the Mothership. When you penetrate the shield, then blast the Castle. To score extra points, you can also shoot the enemy spaceships flying overhead. \n \nIf you destroy the Castle, you advance to the next level, where you will need to contend with Focused Energy Beams, or FEBs, fired from the Mothership. There will also be stars appearing in the sky, making it harder to target the spaceships. \n \nIf you manage to obliterate the Castle again, you will proceed to the next level, which adds ground-based tanks assaulting you. You have Horizontal Trajectory Missiles, or HTMs, to deal with this new enemy but do not lose sight of your primary goal. \n \nYour joystick moves you left or right. The lower button fires VTMs, the upper button fires HTMs.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/castle-blast"}]}
