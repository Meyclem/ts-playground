Life is quiet so Tomoki gets his kicks by being a peeping tom who has a number of prime viewing areas that he has mapped around town. Tomoki would be content to live this way forever, but one night a strange event changes his life forever. While watching the sky and waiting for two friends, from above an object falls from the heavens which turns out to be a female being known as an Angeloid. Her name is Ikaros and she sports a shock of pink hair, angel wings, and a large bosom. Ikaros bonds with Tomoki and takes him on a radical change of life experiences. The PSP game plies the interactive adventure trade which features a new story based on the animated source material. The dialogue is accompanied by speech for added ambiance. At the outset of the adventure, the somewhat mechanical song of the cicada signals the approach of summer. Once the warm weather arrives, the citizenry of Sorami visit hot springs, the beach, parks, and other locations that are amenable to lazy day lounging and sloth. It is within this backdrop that the cast of the PSP game interact, utilize card magic, and effect changes in the Angeloids that populate the adventure.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sora-no-otoshimono-dokidoki-summer-vacation"},{"id":113893,"collection":{"id":61,"created_at":1301356800,"games":[223,224,225,226,260,898,899,2158,3158,3212,4151,5156,5528,5529,5530,5531,5532,5533,5534,5535,5536,5537,5538,7645,10632,10980,10981,10982,13098,13112,13113,13114,13115,13116,13117,13118,13119,13120,13121,13122,13123,13124,13125,13126,13127,13128,13129,13130,13131,13132,13133,13134,13135,13136,13137,13138,13139,13140,13143,13144,13145,13146,13147,13148,13149,13150,13151,13152,15748,24373,25321,26740,28558,28859,45115,45116,54696,67822,67873,67879,72891,73431,75675,77215,102585,110840,113893,116594,119318,120981,121021,121022,121023,121024,121025,121026,121027,121028],"name":"The Sims","slug":"the-sims","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/the-sims","checksum":"88f49bf1-cb76-6bc3-d53f-47b96808665e"},"cover":{"id":92890,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":113893,"height":1226,"image_id":"co1zoa","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1zoa.jpg","width":920,"checksum":"82a4d2c3-007c-1fb6-5126-4f2adc88dd7e"},"first_release_date":1139443200,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":72951,"company":{"id":1,"description":"Electronic Arts Inc. is a leading global interactive entertainment software company.

This \ngame also has a series list that would please American fans, with 4 featured \ntitles already released in America; Gundam: Char's Counterattack, Nadesico: \nPrince of Darkness, Rahxephon and Neon Genesis Evangelion. New systems, such as \nthe Double Attack system and Favourite System are also thrown in as Banpresto \ncontinue to refresh their series again and again.Super Robot Taisen MX Portable is a Strategy game, developed and published by Banpresto, which was released in Japan in 2005.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-robot-wars-mx-portable"},{"id":44487,"collection":{"id":4211,"created_at":1509580800,"games":[4849,7006,21514,44487,75349,79855],"name":"Hannah Montana","slug":"hannah-montana","updated_at":1509580800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/hannah-montana","checksum":"ef7a1ef0-596f-65f9-9d57-d00b09d993ef"},"cover":{"id":49769,"game":44487,"height":768,"image_id":"olcifbtgu9xuukjzo19v","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/olcifbtgu9xuukjzo19v.jpg","width":450,"checksum":"9e182d9c-6e31-d60a-7463-e3b86a9ec100"},"first_release_date":1262217600,"genres":[{"id":7,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Music","slug":"music","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/music","checksum":"22d44a0d-89c7-580f-eef2-e06f178fdd47"}],"name":"Hannah Montana: Rock out the Show","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":175642,"category":2,"created_at":1568246400,"date":1262217600,"game":44487,"human":"2009","m":12,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1568332800,"y":2009,"checksum":"f95e8e80-1b07-417c-3d97-c86ad306c6f8"}],"screenshots":[{"id":333116,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":44487,"height":614,"image_id":"sc7518","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7518.jpg","width":1078,"checksum":"f5bf8ac9-2a38-b2cd-e750-f08e1939500a"},{"id":333117,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":44487,"height":611,"image_id":"sc7519","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7519.jpg","width":1075,"checksum":"a8a8be8d-21dc-3c76-0441-18461f89241a"},{"id":333118,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":44487,"height":617,"image_id":"sc751a","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc751a.jpg","width":1073,"checksum":"f7b5d5e5-7881-33e6-6864-c2de11cc9e14"}],"slug":"hannah-montana-rock-out-the-show","summary":"Hannah Montana: Rock Out the Show is the first Hannah Montana game on the PSP.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hannah-montana-rock-out-the-show"},{"id":45999,"first_release_date":1228953600,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"name":"Mawaskes","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":99961,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":1228953600,"game":45999,"human":"Dec 11, 2008","m":12,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1500595200,"y":2008,"checksum":"798ece88-41ba-bc70-d219-a43425fdd2c5"}],"slug":"mawaskes","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mawaskes"},{"id":38467,"cover":{"id":77520,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":38467,"height":1019,"image_id":"co1ntc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ntc.jpg","width":588,"checksum":"48373000-38c2-390f-2396-597735f7ee6c"},"first_release_date":1351987200,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":82666,"company":{"id":2092,"description":"Imageepoch (イメージエポック) was a Japanese video game developer based out of Tokyo, Japan.

You do this by constructing towers along the path to attack oncoming Vectoids. Success is not based solely on the types of tower you select, but where you place them and what upgrade and bonus options you take. \n \nAt your disposal are eleven flavors of towers, each of which can be upgraded to level 10 (increasing the tower’s damage and range). The Green Lasers, for example, lock onto one Vectoid and deal ongoing damage. The Red Spammer fires heat-seeking rockets at random targets in range. Blue Ray towers drain power and cause Vectoids to slow down. The in-game guide lists each tower in detail. Every few waves you’ll also be rewarded with a Yellow Energy Cell, which you can use to purchase one of three Boosts. Damage and Range Booster towers can be placed on a grid to increase the stats of other towers around it. \n \nVector TD for PSP features eight maps (two Beginner, three Normal, three Extreme) as well as all eleven tower and seven enemy types of the original Flash version. Exclusive to the minis version is a brand-new control interface — you’ll be able to select each gri’ using the D-pad or analog stick and place/upgrade towers.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/vector-td"},{"id":38463,"first_release_date":1159056000,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"name":"King's Field: Additional II","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":87180,"category":0,"created_at":1498348800,"date":1159056000,"game":38463,"human":"Sep 24, 2006","m":9,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1498348800,"y":2006,"checksum":"135e7bae-0edb-672d-729f-32838a815c19"}],"slug":"kings-field-additional-ii","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kings-field-additional-ii"},{"id":78496,"cover":{"id":79962,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":78496,"height":451,"image_id":"co1pp6","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1pp6.jpg","width":338,"checksum":"26b0241d-2f7e-94db-852d-00a50304f175"},"first_release_date":1272499200,"franchises":[{"id":1188,"created_at":1513641600,"games":[72692,78496],"name":"Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru","slug":"otome-wa-boku-ni-koishiteru","updated_at":1513641600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/otome-wa-boku-ni-koishiteru","checksum":"3ef3d780-1bdf-2a33-f485-4f117b356d02"}],"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":59262,"company":{"id":2997,"name":"Alchemist","slug":"alchemist"}}],"name":"Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru Portable","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":131583,"category":0,"created_at":1513641600,"date":1272499200,"game":78496,"human":"Apr 29, 2010","m":4,"platform":38,"region":5,"updated_at":1513641600,"y":2010,"checksum":"11009c44-f961-54fc-ad3e-925a8398d6f9"}],"slug":"otome-wa-boku-ni-koishiteru-portable","summary":"This is Playstation Portable version of the eriotic visual novel of the same name.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/otome-wa-boku-ni-koishiteru-portable"},{"id":45991,"first_release_date":1381536000,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Brothers Conflict: Brilliant Blue","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":99941,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":1381536000,"game":45991,"human":"Oct 12, 2013","m":10,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1500595200,"y":2013,"checksum":"6a39eecf-8f95-8d98-2b74-063ef27384a7"}],"slug":"brothers-conflict-brilliant-blue","summary":"After her mom re-married, Ema moved into the Asahina Family House and acquired 11 brothers.

In each level there are obstacles, deadly traps, hazards and creatures which can delay the player from completing the level.","total_rating":60,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/frantix"},{"id":19660,"collection":{"id":1146,"created_at":1420588800,"games":[7098,7099,7100,8479,11059,18386,19621,19623,19626,19635,19649,19660,21709,24281,25112,28176,28177,42855,44562,44661,46665,47455,104784],"name":"Naruto: Ultimate Ninja","slug":"naruto-ultimate-ninja","updated_at":1420588800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/naruto-ultimate-ninja","checksum":"966f557b-e975-62f3-34aa-04bbe3513565"},"cover":{"id":85879,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":19660,"height":1067,"image_id":"co1u9j","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1u9j.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"504f7a1a-c1eb-6203-bb11-4ebb23b91767"},"first_release_date":1143676800,"franchises":[{"id":221,"created_at":1390348800,"games":[4026,6847,7098,7099,7100,7101,7102,7355,8479,11059,18386,19621,19622,19623,19626,19635,19649,19654,19656,19658,19660,19958,20602,20704,20778,20846,21122,21161,21231,21260,21372,21373,21375,21709,22797,24065,24066,24270,24281,24287,24289,24310,28175,28176,28177,28835,37358,40263,42855,44562,44661,47455,47824,47935,49751,50575,54778,64486,75836,75837,75838,75839,75840,75841,75842,79297,79298,80120,86425,103288,104784,105056,106295],"name":"Naruto","slug":"naruto","updated_at":1390348800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/naruto","checksum":"24b21cc0-1659-e361-602e-80c369223540"}],"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"name":"Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 2: The Phantom Fortress","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":52326,"category":0,"created_at":1466121600,"date":1143676800,"game":19660,"human":"Mar 30, 2006","m":3,"platform":38,"region":5,"updated_at":1466121600,"y":2006,"checksum":"b4b23e22-f066-8cfc-604a-13e380ad7c6d"},{"id":52327,"category":0,"created_at":1466121600,"date":1214265600,"game":19660,"human":"Jun 24, 2008","m":6,"platform":38,"region":2,"updated_at":1466121600,"y":2008,"checksum":"e809e927-592c-2f1e-2fd0-53214532aefb"}],"screenshots":[{"id":28531,"game":19660,"height":272,"image_id":"tqluqzguc8cdnythp0ld","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tqluqzguc8cdnythp0ld.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"412f5781-d871-493b-17fd-72e35abafe62"}],"slug":"naruto-ultimate-ninja-heroes-2-the-phantom-fortress","summary":"In NARUTO: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 2: The Phantom Fortress, players take a custom party of four NARUTO characters through over 100 floors of the castle, experiencing fierce one-on-one battles, exciting minigames, and dramatic story twists in an all-out game of survival.

It is a cel-shaded locked-view fighting game much like Street Fighter IV, and includes more than a dozen characters from each publisher's catalog, including contemporary series as well as older classic titles. \n \nThe game features three main modes. First, there is arcade mode, which pits the player against seven randomly-selected characters in order. Next is quest mode, which plays more like a scrolling beat-em-up and tasks the player with fulfilling various time-limited objectives like destroying targets or collecting keys, and which can be played solo or with up to three friend in wireless co-op. Last is the free battle mode, where the player can play a free battle against the computer or a friend via local wireless play. \n \nThe game system is relatively simple; characters have a limited set of moves, but they can be customized per character. Each character can also be upgraded using orbs earned in quest mode to buy new moves. In addition to regular moves, each character also has special super moves, which require use of a special bar which fills as the player lands blows. The player also unlocks assist characters as the game is played, which can be assigned to characters to give special assist moves. \n \nThere is also a database mode where the player can read introductions for each of the playable and assist characters. The full list of featured series are as follows. \n \nFrom Shonen Sunday, characters appear from Zettai Karen Children by Takashi Shiina, Shijō Saikyō no Deshi Kenichi by Syun Matsuena, Inuyasha by Rumiko Takahashi, Hayate no Gotoku! by Kenjiro Hata, Kekkaishi by Yellow Tanabe, Kyūkyoku Chōjin R by Masami Yuuki, ARMS by Kyoichi Nanatsuki and Ryoji Minagawa, Law of Ueki by Tsubasa Fukuchi, Honō no Tenkōsei by Kazuhiko Shimamoto, Flame of Recca by Nobuyuki Anzai, Ushio to Tora by Kazuhiro Fujita, and YAIBA by Gosho Aoyama. \n \nFrom Shonen Magazine, characters appear from Hajime no Ippo by George Morikawa, Air Gear by Oh!great, Fairy Tail by Hiro Mashima, Mahō Sensei Negima! by Ken Akamatsu, Cromartie High School by Eiji Nonaka, Ashita no Joe by Asao Takamori and Tetsuya Chiba, Get Backers by Yuya Aoki and Rando Ayamine, Kotaro Makaritoru! by Tatsuya Hiruta, Samurai Deeper Kyo by Akimine Kamijyo, Tiger Mask by Ikki Kajiwara and Naoki Tsuji, Devilman by Go Nagai, and Cyborg 009 by Shotaro Ishinomori.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sunday-vs-magazine-shuketsu-chojo-daikessen"},{"id":22632,"collection":{"id":114,"created_at":1317686400,"games":[562,874,910,911,1305,7469,22632,25367,42971,44568,47626,53944,66229,76983,99926,100002,100003,100004,134350,134396],"name":"Splinter Cell","slug":"splinter-cell","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/splinter-cell","checksum":"cd1e18bd-7080-e500-7e7a-8f1418f6c12e"},"cover":{"id":93502,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":22632,"height":1253,"image_id":"co205a","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co205a.jpg","width":940,"checksum":"40b7a577-819c-bbac-6fdd-23c564350bd1"},"first_release_date":1144281600,"franchises":[{"id":857,"created_at":1472342400,"games":[562,874,908,909,910,911,983,984,1293,1294,1298,1300,1301,1302,1304,1305,1842,1843,1851,1853,1855,1856,1858,1860,1863,2114,7360,7468,7469,9891,11171,14382,14901,15354,20474,22632,23176,23213,24499,24500,25367,25530,25641,27064,28173,31187,42921,42971,44568,47626,53944,55167,57686,65129,76218,76983,77976,77978,82078,90099,91311,99926,100002,100003,100004,118218,118900,119071,119262,119355,129847,129879,129892,129895,129896,129897,129900,129901,129902,129903],"name":"Tom Clancy’s","slug":"tom-clancys","updated_at":1472342400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/tom-clancys","checksum":"d93a131c-18dd-a891-22a5-a3ed56ee0600"}],"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":86900,"company":{"id":20220,"name":"Ubisoft Divertissements","slug":"ubisoft-divertissements"}}],"name":"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Essentials","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":68513,"category":0,"created_at":1493251200,"date":1144281600,"game":22632,"human":"Apr 06, 2006","m":4,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1493251200,"y":2006,"checksum":"2cd9ce30-0416-3ac0-04b2-1c95cc0c4527"}],"screenshots":[{"id":338047,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":22632,"height":272,"image_id":"sc78u7","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc78u7.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"278b57a5-5559-dde7-7fea-f48d0f057b1d"},{"id":338048,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":22632,"height":272,"image_id":"sc78u8","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc78u8.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"5fb3b20a-cd4d-0bdb-7868-a644d2fa822c"},{"id":338049,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":22632,"height":272,"image_id":"sc78u9","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc78u9.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"f95e61fb-5637-7a50-8388-78f9eee46dbb"}],"slug":"tom-clancys-splinter-cell-essentials","summary":"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Essentials is an action-adventure video game with heavy emphasis on stealth.

With Alex's adopted sister Luna and his mysterious pet Nall in tow, Alex heads off on what seems to be a meaningless adventure, not knowing that it would be the first step in an epic journey with the fate of the entire world at stake.","total_rating":83.75,"total_rating_count":5,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/lunar-silver-star-harmony"},{"id":42871,"first_release_date":1266105600,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"name":"Kentoushi Gladiator Begins","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":89891,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":1266105600,"game":42871,"human":"Feb 14, 2010","m":2,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":2010,"checksum":"d5ce80e9-6055-2ed4-f7fc-310d422ee103"}],"slug":"kentoushi-gladiator-begins","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kentoushi-gladiator-begins"},{"id":22509,"collection":{"id":12,"created_at":1298937600,"games":[90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,526,2074,3193,7115,10965,11639,21696,21699,22509,23161,25635,26186,26297,27929,36662,72073,74104,84701,117321,119161,121504,121824,122269],"name":"Need for Speed","slug":"need-for-speed","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/need-for-speed","checksum":"f142f79e-5791-b61b-e0af-8906c647bc82"},"cover":{"id":93669,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":22509,"height":2000,"image_id":"co209x","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co209x.jpg","width":1500,"checksum":"2e70d884-e683-1074-0f05-19af4c8134af"},"first_release_date":1111104000,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":82772,"company":{"id":1978,"name":"Team Fusion","slug":"team-fusion"}},{"id":82773,"company":{"id":1,"description":"Electronic Arts Inc. is a leading global interactive entertainment software company.

Now, hunted by incumbent powers desperate to reclaim the girl and armed with a weapon capable of reshaping the realm, the Resistance must wage war to deliver themselves from the tyranny of their oppressors. \nAs original as its narrative, Gungnir's strategy RPG mechanics offer a number of fresh twists on an expertly honed formula. Building upon the traditional action queue of turn-based strategy RPGs, actions in Gungnir all have a numerical wait interval associated with them. Faster actions bear smaller numbers, allowing them to precede slower preexisting attacks. Should the player wish, they may sacrifice tactical points, which afford them more combat options, in order to accelerate actions. This classic balance of risk and reward, a staple of Sting titles, enriches the Gungnir's deep strategic battles and gives the player far more critical decisions to weigh.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gungnir"},{"id":22508,"collection":{"id":1008,"created_at":1404172800,"games":[7476,22508,23006],"name":"Untold Legends","slug":"untold-legends","updated_at":1404172800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/untold-legends","checksum":"6c2db7aa-e307-29fa-09d2-2ae80f27f180"},"cover":{"id":79937,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":22508,"height":1503,"image_id":"co1poh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1poh.jpg","width":1127,"checksum":"b80895ad-0984-ab54-5e71-f279a24411bf"},"first_release_date":1114300800,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Untold Legends: Brotherhood of the Blade","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":89826,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1114300800,"game":22508,"human":"Apr 24, 2005","m":4,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":2005,"checksum":"5a838ef6-4e59-9790-1457-02c720358f63"}],"slug":"untold-legends-brotherhood-of-the-blade","summary":"Untold Legends is a hack'n'slash game for the PSP.","total_rating":63.3333333333333,"total_rating_count":3,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/untold-legends-brotherhood-of-the-blade"},{"id":44491,"collection":{"id":2670,"created_at":1492646400,"games":[23430,25913,28192,42724,42745,42892,44491,64493,66923,79271,79327,80198,80199,92347,126179],"name":"DJMAX","slug":"djmax","updated_at":1492646400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/djmax","checksum":"3d9fbdd5-e519-80df-a9a1-be978daf2ec2"},"cover":{"id":81800,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":44491,"height":512,"image_id":"co1r48","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1r48.jpg","width":366,"checksum":"503d0373-9d93-68d9-cf65-e196161bc663"},"first_release_date":1289692800,"genres":[{"id":7,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Music","slug":"music","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/music","checksum":"22d44a0d-89c7-580f-eef2-e06f178fdd47"}],"name":"DJMax Portable 3","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":99974,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":1289692800,"game":44491,"human":"Nov 14, 2010","m":11,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1500595200,"y":2010,"checksum":"54ddc95c-0739-9e8c-4a59-ffefb7a3bbe2"}],"screenshots":[{"id":112870,"game":44491,"height":680,"image_id":"qac9k49w9mynckdowvvb","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qac9k49w9mynckdowvvb.jpg","width":1200,"checksum":"4fd0e326-b2f8-1374-408f-284e9834f621"},{"id":112871,"game":44491,"height":680,"image_id":"qp8e8ioqjeegotifccpc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qp8e8ioqjeegotifccpc.jpg","width":1200,"checksum":"c811c00e-685e-e25b-9f4d-9edd203ffa9b"}],"slug":"djmax-portable-3","summary":"Max out your mixing skills with this portable DJ sim that comes loaded with 50 unique tracks to mix and new challenges to conquer.

The game is developed by Backbone Entertainment in conjunction with Harmonix and is distributed by MTV Games and Electronic Arts. The game was released in North America and Europe on June 9, 2009. \n \nThe core game is functionally similar to the note-matching gameplay of Harmonix's previous titles, Frequency and Amplitude, with the player responsible for playing all four instruments—lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals—using the Portable's controls.

Unique to Heat the Soul 3 are \"Soul Road\" and \"Karakura Heroes.\" In Soul Road, the player is to select the desired character and partner character. Afterwards, the player is set on a board game-like map where the goal is to pass through markers in order to fight enemies. After each match, the player is given an amount of \"Trust points\" (how many received depends on the mode's difficulty) which go towards leveling up partner characters and unlocking bonuses, such as alternate costumes and new partners. To unlock these bonuses, the player must find a blue marker to turn in their points; however, before doing so, the player must answer a multiple choice question. In Karakura Heroes, the player is put into a humorous side-story, with some extra anime scenes added. Don Kanonji leads a group of shinigami, initially Byakuya Kuchiki and Tōshirō Hitsugaya, on some sort of wacky adventure which involves battling several other characters. At the mode's completion, a scene shows the gang relaxing at an expensive hotel, doing activities that in some way fit their personalities and/or abilities (for example, Hitsugaya snowboarding).","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bleach-heat-the-soul-3"},{"id":44508,"cover":{"id":54525,"game":44508,"height":1985,"image_id":"z7ebb85bmjzspqgksrb3","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z7ebb85bmjzspqgksrb3.jpg","width":985,"checksum":"270420da-e98b-5f14-e786-3a21c30e6bec"},"first_release_date":1174348800,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"name":"M.A.C.H","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":99947,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":1174348800,"game":44508,"human":"Mar 20, 2007","m":3,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1500595200,"y":2007,"checksum":"aeba7ee2-189c-02ef-d9f8-2b93dde1c4dc"}],"slug":"mach","summary":"Welcome to the world of M.A.C.H.

The game is based on testing the model of human intelligence developed by Dr. Masuo Koyasu at Kyoto University. \n \nPQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 shares many features with the first PQ game and similar platform-like puzzle games. In each stage, the player controls a human avatar in a virtual reality world, climbing and dropping from levels, lifting, dropping, pushing and pulling boxes in order to activate switches and lifts, block laser beams, and to create stairways in order to reach an exit point. The player must also avoid guards that make rounds on the level. \n \nThe main game is presented as an intelligence test of 100 stages. The player is given a total cumulative time of 5 hours to complete all 100 puzzles; time is only counted while the player is performing the puzzles, and the player can save and come back at any time without time penalty. The player's score is based on the number of \"moves\" (excluding walking around) on the stage, the time it took to complete it, and the number of attempts at that stage. A player can skip a stage with a scoring penalty; levels not completed in the 5 hour limit are also penalized against the player. Once completed, the player can upload their score to worldwide scoring tables to compare their results. \n \nObstacles in levels include: \n \nBoxes. Small opaque boxes can be picked up and dropped, and their height is the maximum height that the avatar can climb up on, thus these are commonly used to make stairs. Larger boxes can be pushed or pulled. \nGlass boxes. These boxes operate like regular boxes, but will shatter if dropped from any height or hit by something dropped on them. They also are translucent and will allow both laser and regular light through. \nLaser boxes. Like regular boxes but have laser beams that come out of one end. Crossing the beams will prematurely end the level. \nSwitch panels and switch boxes. Colored switches, when active, will activate platforms that may move across the field or that increase height, while deactivating a switch will cause these platforms to return to their original position. Floor panels are active by stepping on them or placing a box on them, while switch boxes require a laser beam to hit them. \nTeleporters. These can be moved like boxes and will teleport the avatar between the end points. \nPolice officers. These characters roam from one police call box to the next closest one, and shine a line in front of them. Should the avatar be caught in this light, the level must be restarted. The police call boxes can be moved to alter the police officier's behavior. \nDetectives. These characters will follow a specific roaming path until they discover footprints left by the avatar. At this point, they will follow the footprints until either the trail is lost, they find an obstacle they cannot pass through, or until they catch the avatar (which then will restart the level). Footprints will disappear after a number of steps, but can also be manipulated by using boxes and other obstacles. \nPQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 introduces the ability to create one's own levels to share with friends, and a \"weekly quiz\" that can be downloaded through the Internet.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pq2-practical-intelligence-quotient-2"},{"id":42853,"cover":{"id":51947,"game":42853,"height":1093,"image_id":"gaky6rkoshemmkeec5wr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gaky6rkoshemmkeec5wr.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"d7d8aa04-f2f7-71d0-3a8f-0b784db775a8"},"first_release_date":1163721600,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"name":"WTF: Work Time Fun","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":89861,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1163721600,"game":42853,"human":"Nov 17, 2006","m":11,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":2006,"checksum":"a83219b1-3629-4121-5390-dbf9d21c1fd7"}],"slug":"wtf-work-time-fun","summary":"Created specifically for the PSP system, WTF is a crazy collection of fun and addictive mini-games that drive the player to perform sometimes trivial, sometimes mind-bending, but always fun jobs in pursuit of the almighty dollar.

Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus. The publisher has become a somewhat of a well-known presence in the North American market, having won RPGLand's \"Stateside Publisher of the Year Award\" in 2009.","logo":{"id":457,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":300,"image_id":"kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"04ccf3d2-0f38-8c2f-6104-b6941712aecc"},"name":"NIS America","slug":"nis-america"}}],"name":"Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness","platforms":[38],"rating":80.09766534617411,"rating_count":5,"release_dates":[{"id":201137,"category":0,"created_at":1592870400,"date":1164844800,"game":22528,"human":"Nov 30, 2006","m":11,"platform":38,"region":5,"updated_at":1592870400,"y":2006,"checksum":"02f568ca-6f90-b01c-3f0f-d1d2871a2034"},{"id":201138,"category":0,"created_at":1592870400,"date":1193702400,"game":22528,"human":"Oct 30, 2007","m":10,"platform":38,"region":2,"updated_at":1592870400,"y":2007,"checksum":"0b52dc16-d8c4-bc1f-2e96-fe6d81fec53c"},{"id":201139,"category":0,"created_at":1592870400,"date":1197590400,"game":22528,"human":"Dec 14, 2007","m":12,"platform":38,"region":1,"updated_at":1592870400,"y":2007,"checksum":"27696bad-da46-9584-325e-474c31796a7a"},{"id":201140,"category":0,"created_at":1592870400,"date":1198108800,"game":22528,"human":"Dec 20, 2007","m":12,"platform":38,"region":3,"updated_at":1592870400,"y":2007,"checksum":"c0796282-ade2-fd4d-b17a-f7f47f59fe67"}],"screenshots":[{"id":389767,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":22528,"height":272,"image_id":"sc8cqv","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8cqv.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"a7ed75ab-35fc-0a87-0074-5d3462ab6a5d"},{"id":389768,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":22528,"height":272,"image_id":"sc8cqw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8cqw.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"096caffb-e934-a477-c9de-9d51c5bc9a9f"},{"id":389769,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":22528,"height":272,"image_id":"sc8cqx","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8cqx.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"7571f25e-5d27-3334-0e23-fc9b864c9d99"},{"id":389770,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":22528,"height":1080,"image_id":"sc8cqy","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8cqy.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"676e26b8-249b-4cc4-9662-56948050d3e1"},{"id":389771,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":22528,"height":272,"image_id":"sc8cqz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8cqz.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"30be55e7-af56-6e66-225b-de289c906193"},{"id":389772,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":22528,"height":272,"image_id":"sc8cr0","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8cr0.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"e6b294f1-2b8e-e4da-e4d0-c83ce11d733c"}],"slug":"disgaea-afternoon-of-darkness","summary":"Disgaea is a tactical role playing game. Battle gameplay takes place on a map divided into a square grid. The player controls a squad of humanoid units and monsters, which each occupy a single square of the grid and do combat with a group of enemies. Depending on the character and attack selected, the player will be able to deal damage to a specific enemy unit or a designated region of the map. Combat ends when all enemy units or all of the player's units are destroyed. \nHumanoid characters may lift and throw other units across the map in order to allow allies to move further or force enemies to keep their distance. This even allows the player to capture enemies by throwing them into the base panel; these enemies then become allies, and can be used on subsequent maps. The chance of capturing an enemy in this manner depends on several factors. Failure to capture the enemy will result in the death of all characters inside the base panel, and the enemy will survive.","total_rating":85.04883267308705,"total_rating_count":7,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/disgaea-afternoon-of-darkness"},{"id":19202,"cover":{"id":50372,"game":19202,"height":508,"image_id":"pofbloehge1gcwc0dd3y","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pofbloehge1gcwc0dd3y.jpg","width":310,"checksum":"d0449cf0-506e-8428-1bae-492a85d720c1"},"first_release_date":1239926400,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Mytran Wars","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":56587,"category":0,"created_at":1473724800,"date":1239926400,"game":19202,"human":"Apr 17, 2009","m":4,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1473724800,"y":2009,"checksum":"946e18cb-68ad-31ce-7b56-212c630ad18e"}],"screenshots":[{"id":30678,"game":19202,"height":180,"image_id":"eqhlyyjarjyzsz2ztopc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eqhlyyjarjyzsz2ztopc.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"83807fa1-22f6-8da8-b690-6f9e7e7df661"}],"slug":"mytran-wars","summary":"It's the 23rd century the Earth's natural resources are virtually exhausted and the ruling multinational conglomerates are searching for new raw material deposits in space in order to avert the Impending catastrophe.

Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

On the main overworld, BRS can explore the available areas and look for certain items. Battle begins when the player comes into contact with an enemy on the overworld. During battle, BRS can aim and shoot with her rock cannon at enemies, block against attacks and sidestep to avoid them completely. If the player fires the rock cannon or uses the sidestep too much in a short time, the system will overheat, leaving the player vulnerable to attack until it cools down. Throughout the game, players can earn abilities that can be equipped to BRS and used in battle, each with their own cooldown periods. These include offensive attacks such as a powerful blast, a sniper rifle, or support abilities that can increase BRS' stats such as her attack or defense. Certain sections will also see BRS ride a motorcycle, in which she can attack enemies on either side of her or use weapons to fire in front of enemies.","total_rating":63.6387602375906,"total_rating_count":8,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/black-rock-shooter-the-game"},{"id":42809,"cover":{"id":56462,"game":42809,"height":1213,"image_id":"odfkcwvakbytysm5jyey","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/odfkcwvakbytysm5jyey.jpg","width":701,"checksum":"416d9642-2609-8312-f0e6-7da48c02da64"},"first_release_date":1248307200,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Pangya: Fantasy Golf","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":89943,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":1248307200,"game":42809,"human":"Jul 23, 2009","m":7,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":2009,"checksum":"0c6f3d33-20f7-7659-f1d9-c05d8dccb527"}],"slug":"pangya-fantasy-golf","summary":"In PANGYA: Fantasy Golf, players practice and perfect their swing on the nine fantasy fairways of Pangya Island.

To escape, the students must \"graduate\" the school. To do this, one must murder a classmate. After a body has been discovered, the rest of the students must work together to discover the culprit. If the culprit can fool the rest of their classmates, then they alone can graduate the school but the rest of the students will be punished. However, if the classmates uncover the true culprit, then they alone will be punished with a gruesome execution while everyone else remains unharmed. \n \nWhile Monokuma releases motives to encourage students to commit a murder, the students also try to uncover the secrets of the school, including why they were trapped there in the first place.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/danganronpa-hopes-academy-and-despairs-students"},{"id":129853,"cover":{"id":91931,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":129853,"height":1980,"image_id":"co1yxn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1yxn.jpg","width":1146,"checksum":"4fc2562a-8f3b-9375-7be7-7fac7712060f"},"first_release_date":1158019200,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":92891,"company":{"id":864,"logo":{"id":151,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":44,"image_id":"s8fufvd2iyb27dl9orps","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s8fufvd2iyb27dl9orps.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"a6e09d2e-cecb-0a7b-60c9-bef8fba2b889"},"name":"Hudson Soft","slug":"hudson-soft"}},{"id":92892,"company":{"id":129,"description":"Konami Holdings Corporation, commonly referred to as Konami, is a Japanese entertainment and gaming conglomerate.

Depending on the pilot that you've chosen, your mission objective and the available Mobile Suits change.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gundam-battle-tactics"},{"id":125290,"cover":{"id":84220,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":125290,"height":301,"image_id":"co1szg","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1szg.jpg","width":215,"checksum":"433018fd-0b1b-0a15-d1a3-97292c504756"},"first_release_date":1293753600,"genres":[{"id":34,"created_at":1571788800,"name":"Visual Novel","slug":"visual-novel","updated_at":1571788800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/visual-novel","checksum":"137fe5c7-e4bc-1c30-4c7c-54596b47448f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":86918,"company":{"id":14130,"name":"GN Software","slug":"gn-software"}}],"name":"White Breath: Perfect Edition","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":179197,"category":2,"created_at":1573344000,"date":1293753600,"game":125290,"human":"2010","m":12,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1573430400,"y":2010,"checksum":"b93f1e3b-2123-3371-1729-9019f5bd0a71"}],"screenshots":[{"id":338088,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":125290,"height":672,"image_id":"sc78vc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc78vc.jpg","width":1236,"checksum":"2ab83f3f-0b5e-1957-868b-2f9ddbe2f5d5"},{"id":338089,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":125290,"height":670,"image_id":"sc78vd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc78vd.jpg","width":1234,"checksum":"bb9f401a-855a-1a55-9a8f-cb1fd5e2648e"},{"id":338090,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":125290,"height":670,"image_id":"sc78ve","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc78ve.jpg","width":1233,"checksum":"c273a6ca-4b21-df84-d77a-de95346ff899"}],"slug":"white-breath-perfect-edition","summary":"White Breath: Perfect Edition is a Visual Novel game, developed and published by GN Software, which was released in Japan in 2010.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/white-breath-perfect-edition"},{"id":42787,"first_release_date":1283472000,"name":"Widgets Odyssey 2","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":89962,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":1283472000,"game":42787,"human":"Sep 03, 2010","m":9,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":2010,"checksum":"4f31a9f8-cb9e-15f5-9557-9fde010ffa4e"}],"slug":"widgets-odyssey-2","summary":"In the Widgets Odyssey saga, five robots aboard their space vessel have just one simple mission ... to save the universe from the tyrannical Yagor and his evil henchmen!

Like previous installments it picks off where the other Heat The Soul left off, the story picks up from the entry of Hueco Mundo to the encounter between Grimmjow and Ichigo. New features include a \"Tag Action\" system and a new way for releasing zanpakutō. Transformations such as Bankai are now made when 2 bars of reiatsu is obtained and then pressing the L button, rather than selecting a character's Bankai form before a fight. There also seems to be 3 styles of tag action: offensive, defensive and technical. There is also a game mode called Tag Master, which lets you choose 2 characters to fight with in a series of fights. The system also includes specials which use the tagged partner's abilities. \n \nThe game features 32 characters usable in Tag Battle mode, while extra characters can be obtained with Bleach: Heat The Soul 4 game save through game conversion. However, these characters are only usable in single mode with no in-game transformation.

While it does include classic features such as exhibition, season, franchise, and multiplayer modes, the life mode is a take similar to the MLB: The Show. \n \nThe life mode has the player take control of an NBA rookie right out of college and just being drafted. As in the MLB Show series, the player may only control one character and cannot control others on their team or make any management decisions. The player's role of the team will be determined by their performance on and off the court. The better the player is at playing basketball and being a teammate, the more likelier they will be a huge part of the team and receive better contracts and endorsement deals. \n \nLikewise, the decisions the player makes off the court will determine who they are perceived as well, such as how they interact with teammates, what they buy or who they hang around with. The player can also train their character through a series of 20 mini-games, e.g. one-on-one, three-on-three, etc. \n \nThe game also features Showtime Gameplay, where the player may increase attributes and become a better team player with no-look alley-oops and highlight reel dunks. It also has online capabilities as well as the option of utilizing the EyeToy to put the user's face onto a created character.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nba-06"},{"id":56551,"collection":{"id":6034,"created_at":1581984000,"games":[56549,56551,56552,60348],"name":"Cinderella Series","slug":"cinderella-series","updated_at":1581984000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/cinderella-series","checksum":"59c8d2a0-a789-7278-ac93-38709b1ecdee"},"cover":{"id":92762,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":56551,"height":914,"image_id":"co1zkq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1zkq.jpg","width":524,"checksum":"73f8f169-6e8a-3cdb-9970-43af3f876dd9"},"first_release_date":1348099200,"genres":[{"id":34,"created_at":1571788800,"name":"Visual Novel","slug":"visual-novel","updated_at":1571788800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/visual-novel","checksum":"137fe5c7-e4bc-1c30-4c7c-54596b47448f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":93225,"company":{"id":14132,"description":"A brand, developer studio, founded by Art Move company.

The 18 teams and 35 drivers and their performance are based on the 1991 season, but the game doesn't include real names. It is possible to edit and save team and driver names by hand. \n \nThe extensive tuning feature influences the performance of the car. In-race setup allows players to adjust gear ratios, brake balance, wing downforce and tires during each visit to the pit box. Six optional driving aids help F1 rookies finish their race: players can toggle best line and suggested gear displays to learn track tactics, or have auto brakes, auto gears, self-righting spins and indestructibility to improve their driving. A replay system allows players to watch race scenes from three different views, including track-side camera footage. \n \nThe game features 3D graphics and various details and effects such as working rear mirrors, collisions with flying debris, crude damage models (wings are visibly bent after crashes), and wet weather that influences traction, including a fog effect that obscures vision when driving in another car's splash water. \n \nWhile the Amiga version allows multiplayer races in hotseat mode, the PC version originally had solo races only. In 1993, the v1.05 update added modem support and a few other improvements.","total_rating":60,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/formula-one-grand-prix"},{"id":24265,"cover":{"id":101004,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":24265,"height":800,"image_id":"co25xo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co25xo.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"53ce8e79-000c-22d4-06a1-7ab69fafed91"},"first_release_date":1246406400,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"name":"Star Ocean 2: Second Evolution","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":99926,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":1246406400,"game":24265,"human":"Jul 01, 2009","m":7,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1500595200,"y":2009,"checksum":"1c7f2757-2d11-ce14-6025-054c4d1e8cd8"}],"slug":"star-ocean-2-second-evolution","summary":"The Second Story's gameplay is broadly similar to that of most RPGs. The player goes from town to town and dungeon to dungeon, following the central story and occasionally branching off to perform side quests. Characters gain Experience Points from battle and level up as a result, becoming gradually stronger as time passes and more battles are fought. \n \nBattles are much more action-oriented: they take place in real time, during which the player has manual control over their character, as opposed to choosing options from a menu. Battles take place on a broad battlefield, over which the player's character can move without limit, allowing them to trade blows face-to-face with the enemy or circle around for a flanking attack. The other party members (up to 3 others) are controlled by the game's AI; the player may change an ally's Strategy to one of six different pre-determined options (ranging from \"Spread out and attack\" to \"Save your Magic Points\" to \"Stand Still and Don't Do Anything\").","total_rating":77,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/star-ocean-2-second-evolution"},{"id":42840,"first_release_date":1148688000,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"name":"Neon Genesis Evangelion: Tsukurareshi Sekai - Another Cases","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":89899,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":1148688000,"game":42840,"human":"May 27, 2006","m":5,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":2006,"checksum":"b1d51d0a-c496-6f6f-cf93-256f2745c3b2"}],"slug":"neon-genesis-evangelion-tsukurareshi-sekai-another-cases","summary":"Neon Genesis Evangelions: Tsukurareshi Sekai - Another Cases\" was released by \nBandai-Namco in Japan in 27/04/2006.

Ivoire consists of vast seas and numerous islands; it used to be a peaceful place, but an ancient (and powerful) force is now threatening life in the various lands. The character you control in the game is Marona, a 13 year old orphaned girl. Marona has the ability to communicate with phantoms, an ability that brings a lot of resentment from other people but will help her to head out into the world and solve the problems that are occurring. A phantom known as Ash acts as Marona's guardian; as the game progresses, other phantoms will join your party, each of which have different capabilities. \n \nThe game features a turn based combat system. During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns. The object you confine a phantom to will affect it's abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower. By defeating enemies in battle you earn experience points allowing to level up and become more powerful.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/phantom-brave-heroes-of-the-hermuda-triangle"},{"id":23103,"first_release_date":1161302400,"name":"KAZooK","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":118180,"category":0,"created_at":1507680000,"date":1161302400,"game":23103,"human":"Oct 20, 2006","m":10,"platform":38,"region":5,"updated_at":1507766400,"y":2006,"checksum":"6adbcbce-c249-1797-c673-d8761d4b6b91"}],"slug":"kazook","summary":"Kazook is a budget-priced mini-game collection for the PSP that only got a release in Europe and Australia.","total_rating":20,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kazook"},{"id":10943,"collection":{"id":817,"created_at":1394928000,"games":[4393,5579,10942,10943,10944],"name":"Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes","slug":"dragon-slayer-the-legend-of-heroes","updated_at":1394928000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/dragon-slayer-the-legend-of-heroes","checksum":"aa529fb0-ac90-4e54-3e5a-c6bd5de04568"},"cover":{"id":10380,"game":10943,"height":680,"image_id":"uwi41qjnnbwexghxxw0o","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uwi41qjnnbwexghxxw0o.jpg","width":393,"checksum":"4c00a4e6-1094-c816-1a19-424c5d8d9d94"},"first_release_date":1117670400,"franchises":[{"id":854,"created_at":1472342400,"games":[1974,4393,5579,6296,10943,11543,14486,19113,37941,41727,62583,70777,71670,72810,73824,78738,93286,105413,105414,105415],"name":"Dragon Slayer","slug":"dragon-slayer","updated_at":1472342400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/dragon-slayer","checksum":"459f5bf2-49e4-8871-7c73-8282bed6546b"},{"id":855,"created_at":1472342400,"games":[4393,5579,8986,10942,10943,10944,13557,13558,16665,23322,23323,26564,28101,42772,75973,78114,78115,90056,105413,105414,105415],"name":"The Legend of Heroes","slug":"the-legend-of-heroes","updated_at":1472342400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/the-legend-of-heroes","checksum":"c59e00b5-6ee8-bbcf-3653-e272327ed39f"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":24101,"company":{"id":5837,"name":"MiCROViSion","slug":"microvision"}},{"id":24102,"company":{"id":617,"description":"Bandai Co., Ltd.

Every route has the same basic structure: the player must first pass a training session, then defeat the dark clones of two of their best friends, defeat one Material boss, defeat the clones of two more freinds, then lastly defeat a Material boss version of themselves.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mahou-shoujo-lyrical-nanoha-as-portable-the-battle-of-aces"},{"id":60365,"collection":{"id":725,"created_at":1391385600,"games":[4834,5207,5208,5209,9610,37148,42866,55967,58471,59914,60040,60365,60366,67604,76643,78347,104992,122538],"name":"Taiko no Tatsujin","slug":"taiko-no-tatsujin","updated_at":1391385600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/taiko-no-tatsujin","checksum":"fd248123-1a07-575a-17a4-6bb86787c441"},"cover":{"id":80112,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":60365,"height":667,"image_id":"co1ptc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ptc.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"27ca3c3b-060c-9cac-7cd6-0c86df6383d6"},"first_release_date":1123113600,"genres":[{"id":7,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Music","slug":"music","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/music","checksum":"22d44a0d-89c7-580f-eef2-e06f178fdd47"}],"name":"Taiko no Tatsujin Portable","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":118897,"category":0,"created_at":1507766400,"date":1123113600,"game":60365,"human":"Aug 04, 2005","m":8,"platform":38,"region":5,"updated_at":1507766400,"y":2005,"checksum":"17a64927-fd26-8633-7e17-140f91bc499e"}],"slug":"taiko-no-tatsujin-portable","summary":"The Taiko Drum Master rhythm game series makes its portable debut.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/taiko-no-tatsujin-portable"},{"id":19262,"collection":{"id":2855,"created_at":1501977600,"games":[19260,19262],"name":"Sonic Rivals","slug":"sonic-rivals","updated_at":1501977600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/sonic-rivals","checksum":"d085f80e-341f-c83f-e64f-38f377aead56"},"cover":{"id":93153,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":19262,"height":1540,"image_id":"co1zvl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1zvl.jpg","width":1155,"checksum":"25919647-fd09-0b84-396e-0b5ffddc7b3a"},"first_release_date":1194912000,"franchises":[{"id":814,"created_at":1464134400,"games":[217,506,1628,2174,2267,2607,3192,4105,4156,4158,4438,5165,5166,5167,5169,5322,5452,6231,6283,6598,6599,6600,6601,6797,7728,7855,9473,9474,9475,9476,9602,9621,11656,15556,16036,19091,19258,19260,19261,19262,19506,19538,19556,19715,19722,19723,19731,19739,19762,20023,20118,21062,21063,21969,22297,23826,24346,25684,38695,39461,43319,43322,43323,43677,45786,45796,45798,46358,47056,47367,50924,51946,52140,52141,52142,52188,52750,54549,54556,54557,56926,69392,72129,74882,76844,77458,79839,88912,90101,94873,95508,99953,103018,112095,112884,112897,119189,121436,122561,125154,128798,129145,129159,129168,129176,129177,129178,129181,129182,129184,129185,129186,129187,130020,133930,133935,133938,133940,133941,133942,133943,134011,134084,134575,135370],"name":"Sonic","slug":"sonic","updated_at":1464134400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/sonic","checksum":"346a594a-ae54-647b-598f-a418111aad2f"}],"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"},{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":52772,"company":{"id":1267,"logo":{"id":95,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":64,"image_id":"wsryowoounitph6vhbrh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wsryowoounitph6vhbrh.jpg","width":71,"checksum":"d02aa3a5-e7f6-b0f0-17e7-42443bc2f72e"},"name":"Backbone Entertainment","slug":"backbone-entertainment"}},{"id":52773,"company":{"id":2021,"name":"Sega Studio USA","slug":"sega-studio-usa"}},{"id":52774,"company":{"id":112,"description":"As one of the leading interactive entertainment companies, SEGA cultivates creative talent worldwide with offices in America, Japan and our European HQ in London.

It turns out that Eggman Nega (once again masquerading as Doctor Eggman) has stolen the Chao and concealed them inside a haunted mansion. His plan is to feed them to an inter-dimensional beast called the \"Ifrit\" who needs to eat them to become invincible . After that, he plans to release the Ifrit into the world in order to destroy it. However, to open the portal to the Ifrit's world, the seven Chaos Emeralds are required. Eggman Nega secretly hires Rouge the Bat to collect the Chaos Emeralds. The Master Emerald has also gone missing (again) and Knuckles the Echidna teams up with Rouge to find it. \nMeanwhile, Silver the Hedgehog has returned from a now ruined future caused by the Ifrit. In order to make a happier future, he searches for and steals the Chao that are left in order to hide them. Espio first thought that Silver was hiding Chao for a cause of evil, but Espio finds out that Silver was trying to save the world. Then, they work together to save the world. The real Dr. Eggman sends Metal Sonic to find Shadow, and tells him of Nega's plans. Nega has learned of the Ifrit by accessing Professor Gerald Robotnik's journals, and Shadow and Metal Sonic set out to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds before he does. Eggman uses Metal Sonic as a communication device to aid Shadow along the way. \n \nAll of the teams meet up at the Mystic Haunt Zone where the portal to the Ifrit's world is. Despite Rouge only collecting six of the Emeralds, the portal opens anyway and Nega dispatches his newly copy of Metal Sonic, Metal Sonic 3.0 to awaken the Ifrit. Despite possessing the minds of Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Rouge (depending on who the player plays as), the Ifrit is defeated by the other teams. Shadow and Metal Sonic defeat the Ifrit and close the portal but they and Eggman Nega are trapped in the Ifrit's dimension. However, Metal Sonic tears his chassis open, revealing the 7th Chaos Emerald. Shadow uses the Emerald to teleport back with Metal Sonic. Nega is left trapped under some rubble. \n \nSonic and Tails save all the Chao and bring them to a Chao Garden and relax there while Knuckles finds the Master Emerald in the Emerald Detector that he and Rouge stole from Eggman Nega. Rouge steals the Master Emerald and runs, and Silver returns to what he hopes is a happy future. Espio has to answer to Vector the Crocodile who has spent their client's advanced payment on late rental fees.","total_rating":60.05771398916095,"total_rating_count":11,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-rivals-2"},{"id":22293,"collection":{"id":6234,"created_at":1590451200,"games":[5003,20142,20628,22293,23125],"name":"Mercury","slug":"mercury","updated_at":1590451200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/mercury","checksum":"f8a0e0ec-18dc-532f-5568-8b0de7604dbe"},"cover":{"id":18908,"game":22293,"height":1121,"image_id":"cvsfkoysldvyarmgjw7g","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cvsfkoysldvyarmgjw7g.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"b0fe21ce-9ee2-8487-8b96-d18db11b5483"},"first_release_date":1112745600,"franchises":[{"id":1855,"created_at":1590451200,"games":[5003,20142,20628,22293,23125],"name":"Mercury","slug":"mercury","updated_at":1590451200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/mercury","checksum":"35bbf54b-c279-eec6-b454-8308a21e7079"}],"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":99820,"company":{"id":25782,"name":"Awesome Studios","slug":"awesome-studios"}},{"id":99821,"company":{"id":833,"name":"Ignition Entertainment","slug":"ignition-entertainment"}}],"name":"Archer Maclean's Mercury","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":107288,"category":0,"created_at":1501804800,"date":1125532800,"game":22293,"human":"Sep 01, 2005","m":9,"platform":38,"region":1,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2005,"checksum":"eaf861d8-371e-b623-5959-b0d81df784c1"},{"id":107289,"category":0,"created_at":1501804800,"date":1112745600,"game":22293,"human":"Apr 06, 2005","m":4,"platform":38,"region":2,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2005,"checksum":"0ec12277-d043-c2ab-c5f5-3561b9eeee35"},{"id":197060,"category":0,"created_at":1590451200,"date":1115337600,"game":22293,"human":"May 06, 2005","m":5,"platform":38,"region":2,"updated_at":1590451200,"y":2005,"checksum":"99bf26af-03d4-029f-9b10-6ab5a66470ef"}],"screenshots":[{"id":385493,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":22293,"height":347,"image_id":"sc89g5","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc89g5.jpg","width":616,"checksum":"b6e961e5-f25b-881b-01d1-cb3fbfb7b161"},{"id":385494,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":22293,"height":347,"image_id":"sc89g6","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc89g6.jpg","width":616,"checksum":"ea01d36a-3e7a-4dff-62d0-f5eb809e99be"}],"slug":"archer-macleans-mercury","summary":"From the mind of developer Archer Maclean comes Mercury, a puzzle game that lets you guide the metallic substance through a series of challenging puzzles.

Players are given control of a small squad of characters (six or less) and placed on a grid-based map resembling a geographical location (a swamp, a town, a river), upon which they fight battles to progress through the game. As with most T/RPGs, positional advantage can be critical to victory, and players are encouraged to outmaneuver their enemies as well as outgun them. The game emphasizes positioning and maneuvering by the inclusion of \"Formation Arts,\" which increase attack damage when an enemy is surrounded by your characters in a line, a triangle or a circle. Wild Arms XF is a member of the small subsection of T/RPGs whose battlefields are based around hexagonal tiles instead of squares. \"Combination Arts\" return from previous Wild ARMs titles, allowing characters to target an enemy in a waiting state and then deliver their attacks simultaneously with the next ally to attack their target. If the player succeeds in executing an uninterrupted series of commands, the damage inflicted upon enemies will increase significantly. On the other hand, the enemy gets the same advantage.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wild-arms-xf"},{"id":23051,"cover":{"id":111703,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":23051,"height":800,"image_id":"co2e6v","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2e6v.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"3f13cf7a-b885-239c-9bcc-ef5daad41902"},"first_release_date":1189728000,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Dungeons & Dragons Tactics","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":85587,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":1189728000,"game":23051,"human":"Sep 14, 2007","m":9,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1497916800,"y":2007,"checksum":"2bd48c4b-9bdf-0ba6-7b2f-aaaf30834a04"}],"slug":"dungeons-and-dragons-tactics","summary":"Faithfully utilizing the Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 rule-set, Dungeons & Dragons: Tactics allows players to take a party of six adventurers into a wide variety of dangerous environments to experience deep and exciting turn-based action.

iDOLM@STER SP is a series of three Japanese raising simulation video games in THE iDOLM@STER game series. They were released on as Perfect Sun, Missing Moon, and Wandering Star for the PlayStation Portable as a port of THE iDOLM@STER. The gameplay in SP features changes from its predecessor, including an additional promise system which puts more of a focus on communication. The games include three game modes: two single-player and one multiplayer mode for up to three players. The story is told from the perspective of a producer in charge of training 10 prospective pop idols on their way to stardom, and each version of SP features different idols. One reason for dividing SP among three versions when developing the games was to allow players to buy the version which features their favorite idols. Rival idols were introduced into SP because the development team felt that rivals are essential for THE iDOLM@STER, which also serve to deepen the bonds between the player and an idol. Including downloadable content, the game features 54 songs the idols perform: 34 songs in original versions and 20 remixes of those songs, which have been released on several music albums.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-idolm-at-ster-sp"},{"id":23115,"cover":{"id":22647,"game":23115,"height":1100,"image_id":"otetdsbaszucyjttastk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/otetdsbaszucyjttastk.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"fa3aac5c-3c23-d255-83fb-c657197bec17"},"first_release_date":1155859200,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Blade Dancer: Lineage of Light","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":89849,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1155859200,"game":23115,"human":"Aug 18, 2006","m":8,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":2006,"checksum":"4ceae297-43b0-5aca-f2fc-f3f672103a32"}],"slug":"blade-dancer-lineage-of-light","summary":"Brandish your blade and dance of the edge of destiny! \n \nA mysterious girl with no memory of her past.

Irem is also known for making their arcade games extremely difficult, and most of them feature a dip switch that allows you to play a \"no death mode\" as a result, in order to allow gamers to be able to complete their tough games.\n\nAs a result of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Irem canceled the majority of its remaining video game projects, including Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 4: Summer Memories and Poncotsu Roman Daikatsugeki Bumpy Trot 2. Irem re-focused to become primarily a slot-machine and pachinko developer, the industry it was in before turning to video games. Its video game division was dissolved in April 2011 and many Irem designers, including producer Kazuma Kujo, gathered to form a new company called Granzella to continue creating games.","logo":{"id":531,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":250,"image_id":"h8chrbkuhzqpxbxlea0t","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/h8chrbkuhzqpxbxlea0t.jpg","width":505,"checksum":"5172162a-be6e-ad16-cd6d-daf1d2b35a37"},"name":"Irem","slug":"irem"}}],"name":"Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 3: Kowareyuku Machi to Kanojo no Uta","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":32459,"category":0,"created_at":1439769600,"date":1240444800,"game":11697,"human":"Apr 23, 2009","m":4,"platform":38,"region":5,"updated_at":1439769600,"y":2009,"checksum":"5faf7d88-1dd7-c26e-6798-86556bf55754"}],"screenshots":[{"id":11926,"game":11697,"height":272,"image_id":"hmsjbgzproqomow73pvh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hmsjbgzproqomow73pvh.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"c3171ec4-77d3-2f9d-921c-cf67c8af4cb6"},{"id":11927,"game":11697,"height":272,"image_id":"v1n3ow869oncrsmx9bls","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v1n3ow869oncrsmx9bls.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"9b82fe5b-5d58-744a-a90f-fa090ac19f2b"},{"id":11928,"game":11697,"height":272,"image_id":"qj3ryh5fv9lio17tdknh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qj3ryh5fv9lio17tdknh.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"5ee76dc2-e163-6a0f-f1d7-5745beb8f202"},{"id":11929,"game":11697,"height":272,"image_id":"gmn3uwkjlne2trezmdv4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gmn3uwkjlne2trezmdv4.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"8842df72-24e2-24fb-d801-35d9d809ea03"},{"id":11930,"game":11697,"height":272,"image_id":"kmcd03doyct9at3tetns","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kmcd03doyct9at3tetns.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"afe502a3-2f35-67bd-8e5c-64b702b1f7c6"}],"slug":"zettai-zetsumei-toshi-3-kowareyuku-machi-to-kanojo-no-uta","summary":"Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 3: Kowareyuku Machi to Kanojo no Uta is the third game in the Zettai Zetsumei Toshi series.

The two player characters have slightly different attributes, which affect gameplay: Naoki is physically strong and self-confident, but becomes stressed more easily, while Rina is physically weak but has a calmer personality, which causes her stress levels to rise more slowly. The thirst and body temperature meter has been replaced by a stress meter. The meter rises after engaging in angry conversations and witnessing/experiencing various traumatic incidents. The player can choose from several responses during conversations, allowing them to choose how to behave towards fellow survivors. These responses allow the player to control the character's personality, and also have occasional effects on the character, such as lowering or raising their stress levels. High stress will affect the character's movements, causing them to have trouble walking. 2-4 players can play cooperatively via ad hoc connection, unlike the first two games, which were only single player.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/zettai-zetsumei-toshi-3-kowareyuku-machi-to-kanojo-no-uta"},{"id":1461,"collection":{"id":306,"created_at":1349568000,"games":[1459,1460,1461,1462,26234,37147],"name":"LocoRoco","slug":"locoroco","updated_at":1349568000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/locoroco","checksum":"3b1c4311-bc80-eb75-04f3-d584375d2a07"},"cover":{"id":77034,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":1461,"height":512,"image_id":"co1nfu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1nfu.jpg","width":366,"checksum":"47dabbc2-64c8-fa59-7a1f-d229534b6643"},"first_release_date":1227225600,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":3905,"company":{"id":400,"logo":{"id":1651,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":169,"image_id":"rfcokievowny1xjmidhu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rfcokievowny1xjmidhu.jpg","width":299,"checksum":"dce5bd43-4e80-9c9e-1653-c4ff44735c0e"},"name":"SCE Japan Studio","slug":"sce-japan-studio"}},{"id":3906,"company":{"id":45,"logo":{"id":885,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":1024,"image_id":"djkfinra1pds0bnz83gt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/djkfinra1pds0bnz83gt.jpg","width":711,"checksum":"e3824481-0a57-aea1-a73b-f6eafe351b26"},"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.

The total number of initial songs is 70, and with the additional downloadable songs thereafter (like every Taiko PSP has done), it matches the massive songlists introduced on the Wii. Like the other recent games, the songlist has become a lot more geared towards Namco Originals. \n\t\t \nPortable DX is also the first console Taiko to show the total number of drumrolls made in the song, and the second console Taiko game to introduce the all new Ura Oni difficulties. Other new mechanics in the game include organizing almost all unlockables in the game into an Achievement list, and a mode called Medley Mode, in which three, five, or eight different songs are put together and played all at once.

The game features Hollywood-style chases and gunfights to keep the action going during missions.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pursuit-force"},{"id":52660,"cover":{"id":80072,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":52660,"height":800,"image_id":"co1ps8","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ps8.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"778e2410-2703-51e6-332f-4a10c3318b85"},"first_release_date":1274313600,"involved_companies":[{"id":63162,"company":{"id":13634,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment","slug":"sony-computer-entertainment"}}],"name":"Pinball Heroes: MotorStorm","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":104892,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1274313600,"game":52660,"human":"May 20, 2010","m":5,"platform":38,"region":2,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2010,"checksum":"9c95a7fe-2203-fac9-2651-80ec55473cbe"},{"id":104893,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1282694400,"game":52660,"human":"Aug 25, 2010","m":8,"platform":38,"region":1,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2010,"checksum":"c977181f-c68e-21d2-c2fa-aea6ca2fb1d6"}],"slug":"pinball-heroes-motorstorm","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pinball-heroes-motorstorm"},{"id":42716,"cover":{"id":51120,"game":42716,"height":400,"image_id":"rr9cywiayfc2jhmgst7z","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rr9cywiayfc2jhmgst7z.jpg","width":233,"checksum":"4dc704c3-5cc2-e52f-49a5-a53d959f0cf1"},"first_release_date":1204675200,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"name":"Downstream Panic!","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":90004,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":1204675200,"game":42716,"human":"Mar 05, 2008","m":3,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":2008,"checksum":"d6733047-6242-bccc-3184-57953d0b1825"}],"slug":"downstream-panic","summary":"\"Downstream Panic! is a PSP exclusive puzzle game where you guide a group of fish from the top of the level to the bottom using tools like plants, water wheels, and realistic water physics.\" - Giant Bomb","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/downstream-panic"},{"id":66611,"collection":{"id":380,"created_at":1368835200,"games":[2059,2060,2061,2062,2063,7442,7489,11397,12527,12595,12736,26603,36550,55090,55111,66611,80524,97247,97248,97249,97250,99228,103015,103016,103017,106688,121828,121831],"name":"Yakuza","slug":"yakuza","updated_at":1368835200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/yakuza","checksum":"22aaedb9-a660-911e-cc85-a8a572782d92"},"cover":{"id":79447,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":66611,"height":388,"image_id":"co1pav","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1pav.jpg","width":291,"checksum":"b4fe0fd0-64d8-1c4a-b4e6-0fa0fb28c57f"},"first_release_date":1285113600,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":69648,"company":{"id":1409,"logo":{"id":1798,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":58,"image_id":"cl1dy","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cl1dy.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"a05880de-361f-22e4-b9ed-83caf81b0f95"},"name":"Syn Sophia","slug":"syn-sophia"}},{"id":69649,"company":{"id":16367,"name":"Sega CS1","slug":"sega-cs1"}},{"id":69650,"company":{"id":112,"description":"As one of the leading interactive entertainment companies, SEGA cultivates creative talent worldwide with offices in America, Japan and our European HQ in London.

For example, who ever thought to mix colour matching with time trial style rally racing? And then to decide it should graphically look like something involing alien pond snakes and cellular life? Makes no sense, right? We at PomPom pride ourselves in making as little sense as possible. Hence our decision to do all the above. The result is JellyPops. \n \n \nIt goes something like this: You control a strange snake creature, which resides in a strange pond in a strange world with some strange rules. The aim is to stay alive as long as possible. Staying alive drains your live force, so Snake needs to collect life force gems to keep it going. With time, life gems become more and more scarce, resulting in a desperate race to reach the next gem before its lights out. \n \n \nBetween Snake and the life force gems are a myriad of other beasties that require special attention. Coloured Jellies which boost your gems value when collected as part of a combo. Teethy fish things that try to blast you with plasma. Spikey rocks and walls.

We intended to deliver these words somewhat earlier, back when we covered Football Manager Handheld. Both games are, after all, football management sims based on popular PC forebears and revised for PSP, both were released around the same time, and indeed we started our reviewing in tandem. \n \nIt's just that Championship Manager 2006 has taken a little bit longer. \n \nThere are three reasons for this. The first is that, well, it's rather extensive. Whereas Football Manager Handheld opted for a cut-down, retro approach, Championship Manager 2006 goes the other way. It's every bit as huge as its PC parent, covering 55 leagues from the 12 leading footballing nations. \n \nGranted you can only play with the leagues of one country at a time, but each country has all the appropriate teams in all divisions, as well as reserve teams and youth squads. Each of the resultant 25,000 players has the usual mountain of statistics spread over five screens, detailing their skills, form and happiness, and they can all be trained, transfer-listed, praised or damned in the media, fined, demoted or promoted through the ranks, loaned or sold. \n \nThe transfer market is equally thorough, with a filtering system that enables you to search for specifically skilled players augmented by features like being able to scout or declare an interest in a player to unsettle them, and complex deals involving player-exchanges and sweeteners. With clubs negotiating deals or pulling out and media speculation and disgruntled footballers playing their part, Championship Manager 2006 feels real in a way that Football Manager Handheld didn't quite manage. \n \nThe matches themselves are equally involved affairs. There are six different ways to view the action, ranging from quick result to textual descriptions, possession bars, and a 2D match view complete with crowd sounds. \n \nThe latter is obviously the most tantalising attraction. When you're starting as a manager watching your charges (well, coloured circles) scurry around the pitch is even more hypnotic than viewing a mute pub TV, especially at the slowest speed. Combine this with more tactical options than Mourinho could ask for (custom formations, specific team and individual tactics, and even specific runs and passes for players to make) and you'll see how even pre-season friendlies can absorb hours. \n \nYou might also comprehend why it has taken us weeks of on-and-off play (and multiple recharges) to get through just a season. And though the more casual armchair manager might want to skip through things a little more rapidly (or even take advantage of the shorter Challenge mode), the faithful should be over the moon, Brian. \n \nSadly, the second reason for our delayed review – the interface – isn't as positive. At least ten per cent of our play time must have been frittered away getting to grips with it, and our first few attempts to navigate the hyperlink-strewn pages without a mouse were as frustrating as watching Lampard and Gerrard trying to play the same role in the England midfield. Whilst we did learn how to use shortcuts to ease this torment, the system (like Sven's formation) doesn't feel completely right. \n \nThe final reason for our tardiness? That's the trickiest. We've been reluctant to file our final review because we wanted to be sure how we felt. \n \nIn many ways, Championship Manager 2006 seems to have all the elements of a classic, but it just doesn't entirely convince us. \n \nPrincipally this is down to the match engine, which can feel like it's trying to recreate pinball rather than football. Stray passes, interceptions and the inability to beat players or shoot on target are all part of the real game, but the frequency of these events here in comparison to moments of flowing football are rather soul destroying. \n \nWorse, there's a distinct feeling that the result you get from watching a match is different to that from a quick result, with reported matches offering far more goals than games you play through. Extreme tactical tinkering can help alleviate the situation, but the base level of difficulty seems less forgiving than Alex Ferguson. \n \nAdd to this glitches such as substituted players seeming to reappear, goals being credited to the wrong player and the way certain teams (like Chelsea) seem unbeatable, and what could have been a life-consuming joy becomes an oddly addictive love-hate relationship, as your hopes are raised then dashed and still you come back for more (perhaps it should be called Football Fan Simulator?). \n \nUltimately, Championship Manager 2006 really is a game of two halves, one of which promises glory of Champions League proportions, while the other has a tendency to deliver conference fare. If next season's outing raises its game on the pitch, it really could be deserving of its 'championship' name. Right now, it remains a promising contender.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/champ-manager-2006"},{"id":52663,"cover":{"id":80069,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":52663,"height":800,"image_id":"co1ps5","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ps5.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"47c51870-9012-fc03-65d6-e2ea37d46c19"},"first_release_date":1274313600,"involved_companies":[{"id":63159,"company":{"id":13634,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment","slug":"sony-computer-entertainment"}}],"name":"Pinball Heroes: Fat Princess","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":104886,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1274313600,"game":52663,"human":"May 20, 2010","m":5,"platform":38,"region":2,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2010,"checksum":"b9969342-b96f-6d54-6020-6d5c9f93f179"},{"id":104887,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1282694400,"game":52663,"human":"Aug 25, 2010","m":8,"platform":38,"region":1,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2010,"checksum":"76acd874-939e-cb01-faea-fe88ed3b0341"}],"slug":"pinball-heroes-fat-princess","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pinball-heroes-fat-princess"},{"id":38465,"first_release_date":1440028800,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"name":"King's Field: Additional I","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":87179,"category":0,"created_at":1498348800,"date":1440028800,"game":38465,"human":"Aug 20, 2015","m":8,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1498348800,"y":2015,"checksum":"5ad602a4-350d-146f-c88d-1d0233aa39e8"}],"slug":"kings-field-additional-i","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kings-field-additional-i"},{"id":11391,"collection":{"id":2196,"created_at":1466294400,"games":[3878,8614,11391,13561,19678,36508,80507],"name":"Digimon World","slug":"digimon-world","updated_at":1466294400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/digimon-world","checksum":"7a9e81b5-3743-c2d7-e064-0a0a9aa75748"},"cover":{"id":10761,"game":11391,"height":1422,"image_id":"gbmulzf91zrqkl6bmapn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gbmulzf91zrqkl6bmapn.jpg","width":826,"checksum":"aaad9ee4-d509-4bb3-e267-0a65ca6b5212"},"first_release_date":1342656000,"franchises":[{"id":191,"created_at":1390176000,"games":[3877,3878,4133,6374,6375,6376,8613,8614,9286,11391,13561,15705,19678,20609,25791,27920,36508,64699,67307,78285,80507,85664,105417,112400,112401,120551],"name":"Digimon","slug":"digimon","updated_at":1390176000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/digimon","checksum":"c6619a77-fceb-6e8b-f7bc-0a834859db0c"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":83203,"company":{"id":1913,"name":"tri-Crescendo","slug":"tri-crescendo"}}],"name":"Digimon World Re:Digitize","platforms":[38],"rating":77.1470432499389,"rating_count":10,"release_dates":[{"id":31546,"category":0,"created_at":1437955200,"date":1342656000,"game":11391,"human":"Jul 19, 2012","m":7,"platform":38,"region":5,"updated_at":1437955200,"y":2012,"checksum":"dffb912d-2f07-7a09-b782-fc86df505c3c"}],"screenshots":[{"id":11192,"game":11391,"height":2180,"image_id":"so9duwmndigkfjtzpux8","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/so9duwmndigkfjtzpux8.jpg","width":3840,"checksum":"1f8f59af-2fb7-0d9f-0155-9f633cbe0e35"},{"id":11193,"game":11391,"height":2180,"image_id":"foqn6dbfs5qiiztcqn2b","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/foqn6dbfs5qiiztcqn2b.jpg","width":3840,"checksum":"9cab697e-9cdc-bbd6-5a5b-909c16ae7905"},{"id":11194,"game":11391,"height":2180,"image_id":"jdp6amupdlw3acvfqkni","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jdp6amupdlw3acvfqkni.jpg","width":3840,"checksum":"16d324b8-807f-6127-ef3e-9396411498c8"}],"slug":"digimon-world-re-digitize","summary":"In the game, the player follows and controls \"Taiga\", a 16-year-old male protagonist who is transported to the digital world of Digimon, which in his universe is merely an online game.

When the game begins, Miabelle's beloved older sister Lily, an accomplished singer, has just been given the honour of serving as Song Princess at a great festival held in the kingdom once every three hundred years.

The player gives orders to the felynes to progress to the end of quests instead of having direct control over them. The game also uses a much more cartoonish art style as opposed to the realism seen in other Monster Hunter games. More emphasis is placed on style and village management. A few Hello Kitty items are also available in the game. \n \nMonster Hunter Diary Poka Poka Airou Village G is an expansion pack and was released on August 10, 2011 in Japan. \n \nMonster Hunter Diary Giri Giri Airou Village is a series of ten television shorts developed to help advertise Poka Poka Airou Village.

As Adol and Dogi begin to search for the sources of Felghana’s recent struggles, they find that each clue leads them further towards the shocking conclusion that these events are all somehow linked. The closer they get to the truth, the higher the stakes are, as the consequences of their actions affect not just Felghana, but possibly the entire world. \n \nThe Limited Edition includes a soundtrack CD and a 4-inch by 6-inch 2011 desktop calendar highlighting artwork from the game.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ys-the-oath-of-felghana-premium-edition"},{"id":76133,"collection":{"id":6100,"created_at":1586044800,"games":[42746,76133,132070,132071,132072,132073],"name":"Storm Lover","slug":"storm-lover","updated_at":1586044800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/storm-lover","checksum":"0ef07d19-dc45-d2c4-5e81-ed95a2f31e5b"},"cover":{"id":47660,"game":76133,"height":301,"image_id":"hg1tgtrspoiykrnmhdia","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hg1tgtrspoiykrnmhdia.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"1fd77460-1d3d-847a-0108-76b2a071eb99"},"first_release_date":1280966400,"genres":[{"id":34,"created_at":1571788800,"name":"Visual Novel","slug":"visual-novel","updated_at":1571788800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/visual-novel","checksum":"137fe5c7-e4bc-1c30-4c7c-54596b47448f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":95725,"company":{"id":22066,"name":"Vridge","slug":"vridge"}},{"id":95726,"company":{"id":449,"name":"D3 Publisher","slug":"d3-publisher"}}],"name":"Storm Lover","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":192543,"category":0,"created_at":1586044800,"date":1280966400,"game":76133,"human":"Aug 05, 2010","m":8,"platform":38,"region":5,"updated_at":1586044800,"y":2010,"checksum":"b03222ac-5e23-3592-2280-a628ec962054"}],"slug":"storm-lover","summary":"A Japanese romance game (Otome Visual Novel) where the player controls a female protagonist in high-school.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/storm-lover"},{"id":132071,"collection":{"id":6100,"created_at":1586044800,"games":[42746,76133,132070,132071,132072,132073],"name":"Storm Lover","slug":"storm-lover","updated_at":1586044800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/storm-lover","checksum":"0ef07d19-dc45-d2c4-5e81-ed95a2f31e5b"},"cover":{"id":96397,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":132071,"height":667,"image_id":"co22dp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co22dp.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"80856c85-d10c-489b-de77-cb4a8ccfd914"},"first_release_date":1371686400,"genres":[{"id":34,"created_at":1571788800,"name":"Visual Novel","slug":"visual-novel","updated_at":1571788800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/visual-novel","checksum":"137fe5c7-e4bc-1c30-4c7c-54596b47448f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":95731,"company":{"id":22066,"name":"Vridge","slug":"vridge"}},{"id":95732,"company":{"id":449,"name":"D3 Publisher","slug":"d3-publisher"}}],"name":"Storm Lover 2nd","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":192546,"category":0,"created_at":1586044800,"date":1371686400,"game":132071,"human":"Jun 20, 2013","m":6,"platform":38,"region":5,"updated_at":1586044800,"y":2013,"checksum":"66050586-6b49-396a-f4d2-a15177f8be41"}],"slug":"storm-lover-2nd","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/storm-lover-2nd"},{"id":2996,"collection":{"id":553,"created_at":1381536000,"games":[2994,2996,3001,42687],"name":"Invizimals","slug":"invizimals","updated_at":1381536000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/invizimals","checksum":"e399c68d-eeef-fa22-9003-0defd1b9b588"},"cover":{"id":2962,"game":2996,"height":380,"image_id":"fho1a2ebeymqewhwhrfp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fho1a2ebeymqewhwhrfp.jpg","width":223,"checksum":"b0d808ae-fdf6-7699-5fdb-bcde15b7aea1"},"first_release_date":1289520000,"involved_companies":[{"id":7479,"company":{"id":45,"logo":{"id":885,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":1024,"image_id":"djkfinra1pds0bnz83gt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/djkfinra1pds0bnz83gt.jpg","width":711,"checksum":"e3824481-0a57-aea1-a73b-f6eafe351b26"},"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.

With the burgeoning city of Midgar as its base and symbol of prosperity, Shinra is on the verge of establishing absolute dominance over the world. \n \nSOLDIER is a group of skilled combat operatives within Shinra. The elite within the group — those strong enough to be deemed SOLDIER 1st Class — are respected and idolized by the citizenry. Zack is a young SOLDIER 2nd Class who aspires to become a 1st. He spends his days carrying out assignments under the guidance of his 1st Class mentor, Angeal. During an operation in Wutai, a large number of SOLDIER member, led by 1st Class operative Genesis, go missing. The severity of the situation prompts Shinra executives to deploy even more SOLDIER operatives in hopes of bringing an end to the war with Wutai—and conducting an investigation into the mass desertion. The ones assigned to the mission are Zack, Angeal, and the 1st Class hero who is known the world over as Sephiroth... \n \nWhat truths lie behind Genesis's disappearance?

NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

Looking to consolidate power, the Corporations (Crest, Mirage, and Kisaragi) have merged into one super-corporation known as \"The Alliance\". Fed up with corporate rule and oppression, and seeing a newfound threat in The Alliance, a Raven known as Jack-O (an important but minor character from Armored Core: Nexus) forms an organization of Ravens known as \"Vertex\" from the ashes of the fallen Raven's Ark. After rallying a sizable force of fellow Ravens to his cause, Jack-O declares that he will launch an all-out war on the Alliance in 24 hours. Leading the opposing force, a Raven named Evangel has rallied just as many Ravens to the Alliance and is preparing to fight Jack-O head on.

A Java ME version for mobile phones was released by Glu Mobile in 2008 titled Metal Gear Acid Mobile. \n \nAcid focuses on turn-based tactics, using a trading card-based system to control the main character's movements and actions. Acid in the name stands for \"Active Command Intelligence Duel\". The cards are not truly collectible, as the game is complete with a single purchase. However, the game does feature deck design and deck optimization elements. The game allows for multiplayer gameplay by wireless ad-hoc connections of two PSPs. \n \nBefore each round, the player can customize the deck of cards used by the main characters. The majority of the cards are based upon elements spanning the entire Metal Gear series, such as weaponry, characters, and even the Metal Gear itself. When the game is started, the player's hand can consist of a maximum of six cards. The maximum number of cards in a deck increases with overall progress. In action mode, the player can choose to use the cards as they are intended or use them to move the character. Most cards only allow the player to move three spaces, while certain cards let the player move up to six or higher. \n \nCost is an important factor in game play and can be summed up as the weight of the player's action. With some exceptions, all cards have a cost attached to them and when used this cost transfers to the player. Cost varies radically from card to card. The higher the cost a character has, the longer that character must wait until their next turn. For example: if a player character has a cost of 15 and a guard has a cost of 10, then the guard's turn would occur before the character's. \n \nSome cards can be equipped; cards such as weapon cards, can have other cards attached to them in order to improve performance. In order to fire the weapon, another weapon card that uses the same kind of ammunition must be equipped. Some weapons don't need to be equipped and can be used by themselves, however they are discarded afterwards. Other cards that can be equipped include equipment cards and action cards. \n \nMultiplayer, or \"Link Battle\", is also a new feature. Two PSP systems running Acid can link wirelessly, allowing players to face each other in a \"sneak-off\". The objective is to collect a certain number of diskettes before the rival player. Diskettes can be stolen by another player, so there is an emphasis on avoiding detection.","total_rating":73.662035143017,"total_rating_count":20,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/metal-gear-acid"},{"id":52726,"collection":{"id":6032,"created_at":1581897600,"games":[52726,59447,129998],"name":"Romeo VS Juliet","slug":"romeo-vs-juliet","updated_at":1581897600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/romeo-vs-juliet","checksum":"1de4a732-3fcd-8a85-11fb-915c02a43d9f"},"cover":{"id":92770,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":52726,"height":600,"image_id":"co1zky","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1zky.jpg","width":450,"checksum":"a2d2e506-dce2-7ad3-1188-a6ccbcb62395"},"first_release_date":1395878400,"genres":[{"id":34,"created_at":1571788800,"name":"Visual Novel","slug":"visual-novel","updated_at":1571788800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/visual-novel","checksum":"137fe5c7-e4bc-1c30-4c7c-54596b47448f"}],"name":"Romeo & Juliet","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":105345,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1395878400,"game":52726,"human":"Mar 27, 2014","m":3,"platform":38,"region":5,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2014,"checksum":"3d3e2969-a65d-5d3f-31f0-7fdb4d25cfeb"}],"slug":"romeo-and-juliet","summary":"Second part of Otome Game Romeo VS Juliet, based upon Shakespeare classic Romeo & Juliet.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/romeo-and-juliet"},{"id":23006,"collection":{"id":1008,"created_at":1404172800,"games":[7476,22508,23006],"name":"Untold Legends","slug":"untold-legends","updated_at":1404172800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/untold-legends","checksum":"6c2db7aa-e307-29fa-09d2-2ae80f27f180"},"cover":{"id":23230,"game":23006,"height":517,"image_id":"avr2lx2w4hsln78tpfmy","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/avr2lx2w4hsln78tpfmy.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"02908f78-1625-823f-1a9d-604c625d1f68"},"first_release_date":1146268800,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"name":"Untold Legends: The Warrior's Code","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":89839,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1146268800,"game":23006,"human":"Apr 29, 2006","m":4,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":2006,"checksum":"7c7c3c5d-be27-534d-2947-20cea83fd75b"}],"slug":"untold-legends-the-warriors-code","summary":"Untold Legends: The Warrior's Code is a sequel to the handheld video game Untold Legends: Brotherhood of the Blade.

Three new game types are introduced in this sequel, including a capture-the-flag variant, and users are now able to create custom tournaments, ladders, and even clan challenges. Fireteam Bravo 2 also offers an improved friends list and instant messaging to help simplify the process of finding worthy teammates and opponents. As in the first PSP title, Fireteam Bravo 2 lets owners of the PS2 version link the two games to unlock special features in both SOCOM titles.","total_rating":79,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/socom-us-navy-seals-fireteam-bravo-2"},{"id":1395,"collection":{"id":295,"created_at":1348963200,"games":[1383,1387,1388,1389,1391,1392,1393,1394,1395,1396,7286,8211,11718,11725,24198,24525,66770,103269,112407],"name":"Dead or Alive","slug":"dead-or-alive","updated_at":1348963200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/dead-or-alive","checksum":"ca2823d5-bd33-c757-d30a-e25c846e0a3c"},"cover":{"id":1505,"game":1395,"height":1033,"image_id":"pnksxzgahyaek9x0rpby","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pnksxzgahyaek9x0rpby.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"586cdfbb-2635-a2ac-5d7b-f17d73683fe5"},"first_release_date":1269907200,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":20940,"company":{"id":4462,"name":"Project Venus","slug":"project-venus"}},{"id":20941,"company":{"id":858,"description":"In April 1, 2010, Tecmo was declared disbanded in Japan.

The handheld versions were criticized for presenting a visual format inappropriate for small screens.","total_rating":67.5,"total_rating_count":4,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/marvel-trading-card-game"},{"id":9270,"collection":{"id":72,"created_at":1302220800,"games":[329,5988,9269,9270,9271,9275,10254,46439],"name":"Dungeon Siege","slug":"dungeon-siege","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/dungeon-siege","checksum":"358e1478-45ae-5d13-3c8a-592842a6ab1a"},"cover":{"id":9564,"game":9270,"height":1103,"image_id":"ehpmfjspkpdu92dlocte","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ehpmfjspkpdu92dlocte.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"0bfc7115-151c-2516-debf-96d5f3e4aff0"},"first_release_date":1162166400,"franchises":[{"id":1789,"created_at":1587513600,"games":[329,5988,9269,9270,9271,9275,10254],"name":"Dungeon Siege","slug":"dungeon-siege","updated_at":1587513600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/dungeon-siege","checksum":"a2fe85f8-230e-5912-f022-98154e72e7ca"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":22612,"company":{"id":814,"name":"SuperVillain Studios","slug":"supervillain-studios"}},{"id":22613,"company":{"id":8,"description":"2K Games is the main publishing company for Take-Two Interactive, created the day after they acquired the rights for the 2K sports series from Sega along with the purchase of the companies Visual Concepts and Kush Games. \n \nAlmost all development studios owned by Take-Two are listed as subsidiaries through 2K Games, or its publishing divisions 2K Sports and 2K Play. \n \n\"2K is a videogame publisher managing some of the most creative, respected and premium brands in games today. \n \nFounded in 2005 within Take Two Interactive, 2K develops and publishes interactive entertainment for PC, console and mobile platforms.\"","logo":{"id":36,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":671,"image_id":"dvjspyvdishtdwdkabu6","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dvjspyvdishtdwdkabu6.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"55871523-496b-a3bd-eb19-fae38f6e8c61"},"name":"2K Games","slug":"2k-games"}}],"name":"Dungeon Siege: Throne of Agony","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":27864,"category":0,"created_at":1427500800,"date":1162166400,"game":9270,"human":"Oct 30, 2006","m":10,"platform":38,"region":2,"updated_at":1427500800,"y":2006,"checksum":"946e6f0e-259a-a6fe-37ce-7b7bd903c9c6"},{"id":27865,"category":0,"created_at":1427500800,"date":1170374400,"game":9270,"human":"Feb 02, 2007","m":2,"platform":38,"region":1,"updated_at":1427500800,"y":2007,"checksum":"99ad1121-3ff2-2a5c-a50d-468c3ae64ed3"},{"id":27866,"category":0,"created_at":1427500800,"date":1170374400,"game":9270,"human":"Feb 02, 2007","m":2,"platform":38,"region":3,"updated_at":1427500800,"y":2007,"checksum":"491c712f-06e8-b9f7-cef4-c5b9628bfe81"}],"slug":"dungeon-siege-throne-of-agony","summary":"Dungeon Siege: Throne of Agony is a role-playing video game for PlayStation Portable developed by SuperVillain Studios and published by 2K Games in 2006.","total_rating":75,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dungeon-siege-throne-of-agony"},{"id":24148,"collection":{"id":5149,"created_at":1513036800,"games":[24148],"name":"SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs","slug":"socom-us-navy-seals","updated_at":1513036800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/socom-us-navy-seals","checksum":"b3cfcd40-1c60-fd69-8fed-1d9f2271cbd2"},"cover":{"id":54219,"game":24148,"height":1036,"image_id":"dm6dc1nv74gwljtt4lhu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dm6dc1nv74gwljtt4lhu.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"d356739d-7fe1-8489-32a3-1d37903e4dce"},"first_release_date":1134000000,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"name":"SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Fireteam Bravo","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":87127,"category":0,"created_at":1498262400,"date":1134000000,"game":24148,"human":"Dec 08, 2005","m":12,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1498348800,"y":2005,"checksum":"058838f7-b1ea-6138-fa9c-03b7bef928b0"}],"slug":"socom-us-navy-seals-fireteam-bravo","summary":"SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Fireteam Bravo is the first SOCOM game for the PSP from Zipper Interactive.

As described by its catchphrase, the game tells \"The tale of nameless soldiers who, on the verge of despair, changed history.\" \n \nThe game was the first in the series to not officially be translated into English by Sega. However, an unofficial fan translation for the Extra Edition was eventually released in December 2013.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/valkyria-chronicles-3-extra-edition"},{"id":38454,"cover":{"id":91948,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":38454,"height":1102,"image_id":"co1yy4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1yy4.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"ef68824a-966f-47ca-711d-6438ed56691d"},"first_release_date":1267142400,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing

The player takes on the role of Ramiro Cruz, a young man who has just witnessed his dad's murder in classic Mexican fashion «combine harvester through office wall», and now he is on a gun-fueled quest for vengeance through Mexico. The second single player mode El Macho is a collection of different mini challenges which do not tell any story but give access to different characters with different gameplay.

The game takes place in a parallel universe to the visual novel Fate/stay night. At the start of the game, the player may choose to play as either a male or female character, as well as selecting one of three Servants — Saber, Archer, or Caster, each with different strengths and weaknesses. Players spend one ingame \"week\" interacting with other characters, viewing scenes that advance the game's story, talking to their Servant in their room, and gathering clues to the identity of the enemy Servant. At the end of each day, they enter the Arena, a dungeon in which they can battle monsters to gain experience points and strengthen their Servant. The game's turn-based battle system is comparable to rock-paper-scissors -- \"Attack\" overpowers \"Break\", Break overpowers \"Guard\", and Guard overpowers Attack. During battle, both the player and the opponent line up six such moves at the beginning of each turn.","total_rating":75,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/fate-slash-extra"},{"id":23084,"cover":{"id":32007,"game":23084,"height":480,"image_id":"ssffl0r0bzcreaqr9a9d","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ssffl0r0bzcreaqr9a9d.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"ff74e4e6-8807-deb2-8e40-97773e9655f5"},"first_release_date":1166659200,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"EA Replay","platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"id":89878,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1166659200,"game":23084,"human":"Dec 21, 2006","m":12,"platform":38,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":2006,"checksum":"71e3325f-5dbb-ea35-b751-f55f3a72be5e"}],"slug":"ea-replay","summary":"nazobmplay is a BMS simulator by tnj.

Super Puzzle Fighter II: Y has player's group similar colors to create groups of three or more. Once the colors are line up, they break and charge up the \"Change Gem\" meter creating furious chains for come-from-behind wins.

Block Block is an innovative twist to the block breaking genre. Released for the arcades in 1990, Block Block features a two player co-op mode, allowing for the cooperative destruction of blocks. Also unique to this title was the constantly shrinking paddle that forced player to finish each board as quickly as possible. Originally released for the PlayStation game console, the Buster Bros.

An arcade hit, Buster Bros has one or two players navigating through over 50 timed environmental stages shooting all the bubbles on screen while avoiding contact.
