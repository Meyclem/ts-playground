The storyline isn't really known since there is no storyline in the game. All you see is Lolo, the main character walk into a castle, and the doors shut behind him. There are 50 rounds in the game, which is less than the other Eggerland Famicom games. The game is unique out of all the other Eggerland titles for Famicom by allowing the player to create their own levels. \n \nLike the other Eggerland games, the objective of each stage is simple; collect all the heart frames and then collect the orb inside the treasure box to proceed to the next level. It won't be easy though; King Egger has sent forth his enemies to take care of you. Lolo must use certain tactics to get by, such as trapping the enemies or knocking them off the screen temporarily.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/eggerland-souzouhe-no-tabidachi"},{"id":63225,"cover":{"id":37152,"game":63225,"height":224,"image_id":"nqlrcbos3mt3qmeflnic","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nqlrcbos3mt3qmeflnic.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"1b67ab28-b5f8-9fb5-7783-f019ec3daaf0"},"first_release_date":659923200,"name":"Wakusei Aton Gaiden","platforms":[51],"release_dates":[{"id":116428,"category":0,"created_at":1507248000,"date":659923200,"game":63225,"human":"Nov 30, 1990","m":11,"platform":51,"region":5,"updated_at":1507334400,"y":1990,"checksum":"5504c4d9-3246-c1df-c28b-aec95dc8eef1"}],"slug":"wakusei-aton-gaiden","summary":"A vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up produced by Kokuzeichou: the Japanese equivalent of the IRS.

After defeating them, the player can select any of the nearby doors to enter: Some lead to different areas, but others will simply reveal a bell for the player to collect. Before the player can take this bell, the game presents a sum and the player must slash at numbers on the walls to complete the correct answer, then hit an \"OK\" symbol to submit it: If the answer's correct, they collect the bell and move on. If the answer is incorrect, the door that contains the bell closes and more monsters flood the room. \n \nThe player can visit a store and a hint section at any time by hitting the Select button. The store is where they can sell their bells for useful items.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/adian-no-tsue"},{"id":41251,"collection":{"id":6095,"created_at":1585785600,"games":[41251,41256],"name":"Famicom Grand Prix","slug":"famicom-grand-prix","updated_at":1585785600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/famicom-grand-prix","checksum":"69715921-e2dd-db46-45d7-188fbc248d36"},"cover":{"id":96180,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":41251,"height":2000,"image_id":"co227o","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co227o.jpg","width":1500,"checksum":"8fbd1edf-23d9-7c2d-a7f8-9a4f18c9e030"},"first_release_date":562550400,"franchises":[{"id":845,"created_at":1470700800,"games":[358,1066,1067,1068,1069,1070,1071,1073,1074,1075,1076,1077,1078,1079,1080,1086,1087,1089,1626,1627,1628,1709,1711,2171,2173,2178,2180,2183,2191,2193,2255,2256,2327,2328,2329,2330,2331,2332,2333,2334,2335,2336,2337,2338,2342,2343,2344,2345,2349,2350,2476,2485,2706,2707,2708,3105,3340,3349,3350,3351,3363,3364,3365,3399,3400,3401,3403,3404,3405,3406,3475,3476,3478,3541,3680,3985,3986,3987,3988,3989,3990,4049,5199,5418,5712,6503,6504,6505,6506,7337,7339,7340,8203,8535,8594,8726,8734,9602,9621,11068,11195,11220,11258,11604,14738,16617,16747,16748,18027,18064,18065,18169,18195,18448,18657,19599,19840,19930,20385,20386,20497,21093,21624,21910,22301,22549,23328,23796,26157,26758,26764,26939,28414,37151,37755,38254,38305,39342,40118,40510,40533,40540,41246,41247,41251,41256,41260,41272,41363,41420,42204,42208,42319,42400,42500,42501,42502,42525,42602,44044,44059,45160,45161,45676,46445,47847,48032,48133,48135,48569,48577,48711,49080,49877,50335,58941,59517,60579,60852,61573,64820,65974,66812,67024,67025,67026,67027,67030,67043,67197,67198,67940,68074,68075,68313,68354,69638,71885,71976,72323,73026,73027,77060,77227,77228,77378,77785,77789,77829,77964,79479,80174,81145,81197,84700,84920,85273,85357,85572,85663,86264,86354,86428,87815,87816,87817,90101,90109,90113,91994,92342,94180,103317,103339,107234,109455,109457,114767,115276,115859,115860,116795,117772,119120,119932,121506,122711,122714,125054,127881,127882,128874,130007,130017,130032,130090,130354,131856,131860,131895,131938,131939,131951,131952,131953,131985,132003,132029,132030,132033,132034,132044,132049,132108,132109,132110,132111,132609,132641,132642,132644,132716,132854,132856,132860,133923,133993,134017,134018,134068,134069,134074,134075,134078,134084,134088,134170,134171,134172,134173,134174,134175,134176,134177,134178,134180,134294,134295,134296,134437,134746,134747,134748,134749,134750,134958,134959,135071,135090,135094,135095,135096,135098,135125,135128,135129,135130,135131,135132,135134,135136,135148,135163,135168,135169,135176,135177,135178,135179,135214,135215,135217,135218,135221,135223,135227,135228,135229,135230,135231,135232,135264,135265,135266,135268,135388,135389],"name":"Mario","slug":"mario","updated_at":1470700800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/mario","checksum":"401b7db5-37b6-038e-60d5-8e81de7022f4"}],"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":97432,"company":{"id":421,"description":"Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development or Nintendo EAD, formerly Nintendo Research & Development 4, or Nintendo R&D4, was the largest division inside Nintendo until it merged with Nintendo Software Planning & Development in September 2015, becoming Nintendo Entertainment Planning & Development.

In the game, players can choose to play alone or with other cars. Cars have a certain amount of health and fuel, which decreases whenever the player crashes into a wall or another car, as well as whenever he or she drives off of the road. This game, along with its sequel, was possibly an ancestor to the Mario Kart series, most likely due to the fact that it features Mario and possesses similar 2D racing mechanics, which was later carried on to Super Mario Kart.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/famicom-grand-prix-f-1-race"},{"id":2406,"collection":{"id":39,"created_at":1300320000,"games":[359,385,386,387,388,392,393,395,397,398,399,400,402,404,405,406,408,409,411,413,415,416,417,418,419,420,421,423,425,426,2406,5679,6902,7398,7399,7400,7413,8549,10319,11214,14144,16474,16587,17463,19080,19334,19455,19600,20597,20655,21628,21779,21880,21899,23265,26069,26625,26981,27410,28002,36998,37087,37193,37291,37563,38492,38493,41052,41831,41834,41835,41836,41837,41838,41839,41840,41842,41843,41845,41851,41852,41853,41854,41855,41856,55034,55035,55049,57862,60600,65986,66433,71219,75680,75681,76430,77234,80589,80877,90563,108156,119374,121688,121717,127876,127879,129890,131995],"name":"Final Fantasy","slug":"final-fantasy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/final-fantasy","checksum":"d120a5d1-da5c-99d7-80e0-4563606e0e12"},"cover":{"id":93501,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":2406,"height":1280,"image_id":"co2059","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2059.jpg","width":960,"checksum":"6b22f775-768c-df50-5d40-9c5a63c4c12b"},"first_release_date":1135987200,"franchises":[{"id":4,"created_at":1301443200,"games":[359,384,385,386,387,388,389,391,392,393,394,395,396,397,398,399,400,401,402,403,405,406,407,408,409,410,411,412,413,414,415,416,417,418,419,420,421,423,425,426,427,428,2406,2407,2408,2449,7356,7398,7399,7400,7413,9585,10319,11169,11214,14144,14723,14729,16587,17463,18068,18069,18070,19080,19334,19455,19600,19865,20597,20655,21054,21628,21779,21880,21899,22894,22895,22896,22897,22899,22900,22901,22902,22903,22904,22905,22906,22907,22908,22909,23016,24010,24288,24400,26069,26625,26904,27410,28002,36831,36998,37087,37193,37291,38492,38493,41052,41830,41831,41834,41835,41836,41837,41838,41839,41840,41841,41842,41843,41845,41848,41851,41852,41853,41854,41855,41856,49559,51532,54550,55034,55035,55049,57793,69176,75680,75681,76160,76163,76430,77234,80877,81206,84174,90563,106819,108156,109276,109461,109465,112412,112885,113632,119374,121688,121717,125583,127876,127879,129157,131995],"name":"Final Fantasy","slug":"final-fantasy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/final-fantasy","checksum":"68dec670-d60a-4632-2f75-b05269a4907b"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":5612,"company":{"id":1150,"name":"ShenZhen Nanjing Technology","slug":"shenzhen-nanjing-technology"}}],"name":"Final Fantasy VII (Famicom)","platforms":[51],"release_dates":[{"id":5202,"category":2,"created_at":1372896000,"date":1135987200,"game":2406,"human":"2005","m":12,"platform":51,"region":8,"updated_at":1372896000,"y":2005,"checksum":"caa6be9a-a2b3-5b4e-ec80-12de214cc119"}],"screenshots":[{"id":2821,"game":2406,"height":240,"image_id":"n0lknfghtglri959z8tb","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n0lknfghtglri959z8tb.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"404cca04-6023-1ca5-707c-03b1c7ac6370"},{"id":2822,"game":2406,"height":208,"image_id":"xjwibri1jvrigpy7se8u","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xjwibri1jvrigpy7se8u.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"4d403ca2-dc4a-34d5-b2ef-2ff974cc26f5"},{"id":2823,"game":2406,"height":480,"image_id":"fmjaj3nputmnfpq9rgfm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fmjaj3nputmnfpq9rgfm.jpg","width":602,"checksum":"6aadd585-e568-2618-2ca6-76236facd441"},{"id":2824,"game":2406,"height":480,"image_id":"wlnvecwc6svihzkzsgli","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wlnvecwc6svihzkzsgli.jpg","width":602,"checksum":"612dd4e0-72d1-709e-4a42-d915e94cf712"}],"slug":"final-fantasy-vii-famicom","summary":"Final Fantasy VII is an unlicensed \"Shanzhai\" demake of SquareSoft role-playing game of the same name, originally released for PlayStation in 1997.

and dinosaurs compete for ultimate supremacy. A young boy has to collect important treasure without being killed by the rampaging dinosaurs. All he can do is attempt to temporarily paralyze them with a specialized dinosaur trap. All treasures must be collected before admittance to the next level is possible. One hit from either a dinosaur, caveman, or other type of enemy instantly kills the player. \n \nLevels range from the conventional cavemen setting of the earlier levels to feudal Japan and even some futuristic levels inspired by science fiction.[4] There are 21 levels in this game with five different bonus levels to gain extra points in. Objects to acquire in the other time zones include radios (retrieved in the World War II stages from Japanese soldiers), bags of money (retrieved in the modern levels while dodging criminals and police officers), computer monitors (earned while dodging robots) and ancient Japanese scrolls (found while avoiding samurai).[","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/booby-kids"},{"id":7904,"cover":{"id":8331,"game":7904,"height":155,"image_id":"e2imhm4upsokgmybfapl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e2imhm4upsokgmybfapl.jpg","width":220,"checksum":"8c7735fa-c541-c2d1-e883-9f50e9719861"},"first_release_date":688348800,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":18527,"company":{"id":716,"description":"Founded as a subsidiary of the Japanese company Natsume Co., Ltd in 1988 to publish games in the United States. \nThe companies separated in 1995 with Natsume inc becoming it's own business.
