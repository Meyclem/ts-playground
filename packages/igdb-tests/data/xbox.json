It was released on November 15, 2001, in North America, followed by Australia and Europe in 2002. It was Microsoft's first foray into the gaming console market. The sixth-generation console competed with Sony's PlayStation 2, Sega's Dreamcast, and the Nintendo GameCube. It was the first console produced by an American company since the Atari Jaguar ceased production in 1996.\n\nIn November 2002, Microsoft launched Xbox Live, a fee-based online gaming service that enabled subscribers to download new content and connect with other players through a broadband connection. Unlike other online services from Sega and Sony, Xbox Live had support in the original console design through an integrated Ethernet port. The service gave Microsoft an early foothold in online gaming and would help the Xbox become a relevant competitor to other sixth-generation consoles.\n\nXbox's successor, the Xbox 360, was launched in November 2005. The Xbox was soon discontinued beginning with Microsoft's worst-performing market, Japan, in 2005. Other countries would follow suit in 2006. The last Xbox game in Europe was Xiaolin Showdown released in June 2007, and the last game in North America was Madden NFL 09 released in August 2008. Support for out-of-warranty Xbox consoles was discontinued on March 2, 2009. Support for Xbox Live on the console ended on April 15, 2010.\n\n Xbox launched in North America and quickly sold out. Its launch in that region was successful, selling 1.53 million units three months after launch, which is higher than its successor Xbox 360, as well as the GameCube, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and even the PlayStation 2 and Wii.\n\nThe Xbox has sold 24 million units worldwide as of May 10, 2006, according to Microsoft. This is divided out to 16 million units sold in North America, six million units in Europe, and just two million units sold in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nThe Xbox was almost always behind the PlayStation 2 in terms of sales, although in April 2004, the Xbox outsold the PS2 in the U.S. Despite lagging far behind the PlayStation 2's sales, the Xbox was overall a success (especially in North America), keeping a steady second place in the generation sales.\n\nThe popularity of the Xbox, as well as (in the United States) its comparatively short 90-day warranty, inspired efforts to circumvent the built-in hardware and software security mechanisms, a practice informally known as modding.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/platforms/xbox/version/initial-version-6ac4b90f-0745-458f-866d-3672aa6ed5eb","checksum":"180afc38-9338-d4e4-151b-52fb01efad3e"}],"checksum":"5f8c11ce-8b65-91da-ab70-5ff52ed35472","games":[{"id":20795,"cover":{"id":16285,"game":20795,"height":680,"image_id":"t1i9syslizdfvldcho6o","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t1i9syslizdfvldcho6o.jpg","width":481,"checksum":"d43d6e38-5c1e-0890-7d07-ed1a5df4c66b"},"first_release_date":1034640000,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":37701,"company":{"id":1006,"description":"\"Headquartered in Helsinki, Finland, Housemarque is a game developer working on console and PC.

In the process of creating monsters with this technology using an ancient creature named \"The Gods of Magic\"; it broke free of its bonds and took control of the secret facility and proceeded to slay all of the research team and arm the compounds defenses. The player is a commander in charge of the Cyborg Enforcer Teams sent into the dungeon to reclaim it. The game featured 100 levels of randomly generated maps, the first ten being the games main story mode. The other 90 were extended play for players wanting to continue playing with their strong characters. \n \nGame play[edit] \nAs the game starts, you create a team of Enforcers for your expeditions into the dungeon, with the option to create over 40 total. When creating your characters you are given the ability to alter height, sex, ethnicity, weight and hair style as well as given a choice between the Fencer, Caster, Analyzer, Striker, or Broader classes; Each falling into a Dungeons and Dragons styled role. Several Advanced classes were available by finding Class Chips in the dungeon and applying them to your characters. Once inside the dungeon, the players team must move around, find monsters and equipment while leveling up. A major point unsaid in game is that you are not expected to be able to beat a level's boss on the first time entering the level; as you could only allocate level up points while out of the dungeon. \n \nDungeons were randomly generated, most adhering to a typical design that made the map seem less random then it was. Each level has a control room that could possibly be locked, holding a boss monster that must be defeated to win the level and unlock the next one. \n \nFencer Fighter class that could use Hammers or Swords and had the rare chance of performing a move like a Final Fantasy \"Limit Break\" that would damage all enemies at once. \n \nAnalyzer Ranged class. Without an Analyzer in the party, the player is unable to know how much health enemies have and their current HP amount. Analyzers used firearms ranging from laser beams, to machine guns, to rocket launchers that all shared the same in game model. \n \nCaster Basic Spell Caster that could be wired with a variety of Spell Chips either bought from the in-game shop or found in the dungeon. Each spell had a number of charges that had to be refilled by visiting the surface. Casters automatically blocked until the player told them what spell to use. \n \nBroader The Jack-Of-All-Trades class that had a flat rate for all skill gains at the expense of leveling up extremely slowly and was reserved for advanced players that foresaw spending a large time grinding. \n \nStriker A barbarian class that used combat gloves as their weapon. Each strike had a rare chance of instantly killing a non-boss enemy. \n \nReception[edit] \nMetal Dungeon was rated very poorly for its simple game play, transparent story, and character creation system. The game's setting turned it into a cult classic near instantly for its magic-punk stylized world.

Epic Pinball was a ten month project written entirely in assembly language by Schmalz that went on to become one of the most successful shareware games ever made, trailing only behind such industry greats as Duke3D, Doom and Wolfenstein 3D. Sequels such as Silverball and Extreme Pinball were released shortly thereafter and together they helped fund the creation of what would become one of the industry’s blockbuster franchises, Epic Games’ Unreal®.\n\nBeginning in 1994, Digital Extremes partnered with Epic Games (at that time, its shareware publisher) and co-created Unreal and its counterpart Unreal Tournament. Both games set new standards for first-person action games and broke new ground in online multiplayer gaming. Tremendously rich graphics, fine-tuned gameplay, frenetic action and high quality production value are descriptions that have become synonymous with any Unreal branded game. To date, the award-winning Unreal franchise, including Unreal, Unreal Tournament and Unreal Championship has sold more than 12 million units worldwide across the PC, PlayStation®2, Xbox™ and Dreamcast™ platforms.\n\nDigital Extremes completed development on its original IP for the current generation of consoles, Dark Sector®, which shipped to stores in 2008, using its proprietary next-gen technology, the Evolution Engine™. Following its success, the studio expanded to two teams to allow for simultaneous development on separate projects.\n\nDigital Extremes completed work on the Multiplayer component of 2K Games’ blockbuster, Bioshock® 2 as well as the PC version of THQ hit, Homefront™.  The company also recently ventured into the mobile world with the release of Retro Pinball for Apple’s iOS platform, a throwback to the company’s roots.  More recently, Digital Extremes earned critical acclaim for the development of first-person action game, The Darkness® II, based on the comic book series of the same name.  In addition, the company assisted Microsoft with additional multiplayer content to Halo®4.

Released on March 18, 2003, the Rainbow Six video game series is based on Tom Clancy's best-selling novel of the same name. \n \nBased on the Unreal Engine 2.0, Raven Shield is a tactical shooter with realistic properties. Raven Shield moved toward mainstream first-person shooters like Counter-Strike, adapting various features absent in previous versions. These included the ability to see one's weapon while in first-person view, many new weapons and upgrades (including larger magazines and sights), and a redesigned multiplayer. \n \nA console version, entitled Rainbow Six 3, was developed for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Nintendo GameCube. This iteration of the game features the same basic engine, models, textures, and artwork, but with significantly different game mechanics, gameplay, and storyline. A port was also released on Mac OS X on December 19, 2003. Due to the console version's success on the Xbox and the popularity of its subscription-based online multiplayer service, Xbox Live, an Xbox-exclusive semi-sequel was released in 2004 titled Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow. The next full game in the Rainbow Six series, Rainbow Six: Lockdown, was released in 2005.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-3-black-arrow"},{"id":67730,"cover":{"id":44263,"game":67730,"height":923,"image_id":"fx0l2du6ngx4kbxthwka","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fx0l2du6ngx4kbxthwka.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"5e4cb73d-0de8-7c26-6a22-d1779f7f79ff"},"first_release_date":1049932800,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":57354,"company":{"id":775,"name":"Paon","slug":"paon"}},{"id":57355,"company":{"id":1010,"description":"Established in 2002 as Microsoft Game Studios to coincide with the release of the Xbox.

An extensive new ten-season Franchise Mode allows gamers to experience player trading and drafting, and improved graphics and animations take advantage of motion-capture technology; making those bone-crunching hits painfully realistic.","total_rating":53,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nfl-blitz-pro"},{"id":1391,"collection":{"id":295,"created_at":1348963200,"games":[1383,1387,1388,1389,1391,1392,1393,1394,1395,1396,7286,8211,11718,11725,24198,24525,66770,103269,112407],"name":"Dead or Alive","slug":"dead-or-alive","updated_at":1348963200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/dead-or-alive","checksum":"ca2823d5-bd33-c757-d30a-e25c846e0a3c"},"cover":{"id":1506,"game":1391,"height":769,"image_id":"wspdn6jgpe4icfzg8zqp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wspdn6jgpe4icfzg8zqp.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"d75bf024-848f-86ed-17d2-a9171beb8c32"},"first_release_date":1098748800,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":13953,"company":{"id":2020,"name":"Tecmo Co., Ltd.","slug":"tecmo-co-ltd"}},{"id":13954,"company":{"id":769,"logo":{"id":105,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":120,"image_id":"hhtghiazexa5izu6usbu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hhtghiazexa5izu6usbu.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"b09c64ad-e7fc-f7e9-50f7-bc8105f5f0f9"},"name":"Team Ninja","slug":"team-ninja"}}],"name":"Dead or Alive Ultimate","platforms":[11],"rating":76.28896683339521,"rating_count":7,"release_dates":[{"id":32548,"category":0,"created_at":1439856000,"date":1098748800,"game":1391,"human":"Oct 26, 2004","m":10,"platform":11,"region":2,"updated_at":1439942400,"y":2004,"checksum":"1590f11d-431d-4e04-358d-2b2c983bc42c"},{"id":32549,"category":0,"created_at":1439856000,"date":1099440000,"game":1391,"human":"Nov 03, 2004","m":11,"platform":11,"region":5,"updated_at":1439942400,"y":2004,"checksum":"b8cb2a82-5c3b-522e-e7df-5d1d0e196598"},{"id":32550,"category":0,"created_at":1439856000,"date":1108684800,"game":1391,"human":"Feb 18, 2005","m":2,"platform":11,"region":1,"updated_at":1439942400,"y":2005,"checksum":"e4294b61-d6df-6ee6-455a-583242425042"}],"screenshots":[{"id":12068,"game":1391,"height":473,"image_id":"jjegerj3vlyg4whs6a44","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jjegerj3vlyg4whs6a44.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"d84224fa-782a-ca67-c034-781bbffc9bda"},{"id":12069,"game":1391,"height":768,"image_id":"bxyj37b1fgvewdqth009","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bxyj37b1fgvewdqth009.jpg","width":1024,"checksum":"3294da84-eba4-9b98-7408-e21c1acd2761"},{"id":12070,"game":1391,"height":576,"image_id":"kdbrpwp6qiihngv0w0g9","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kdbrpwp6qiihngv0w0g9.jpg","width":1024,"checksum":"5a5f5cbc-3003-58b5-54b4-eecb850ecc1c"},{"id":12071,"game":1391,"height":576,"image_id":"fyucmfovzhyzsbz7arka","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fyucmfovzhyzsbz7arka.jpg","width":1024,"checksum":"3a8d023d-318c-65ae-c0f6-4ad1d7c1f024"},{"id":12072,"game":1391,"height":576,"image_id":"etz9dlikdcb1yidxclyl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/etz9dlikdcb1yidxclyl.jpg","width":1024,"checksum":"3e07dc12-84be-49fd-bd31-ac026382ec0c"}],"slug":"dead-or-alive-ultimate","summary":"Dead or Alive Ultimate is a compilation fighting game.

One of the best things about MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 2K5 WORLD SERIES EDITION that sets it apart from the regular baseball titles is the way that the designers have incorporated a new Pennant Fever mode as well as the World Series Championship Moments mode that allow players to experience the game of baseball from a new and exciting standpoint. In Pennant Fever mode players will get to play through the final games of the season from the basic franchise mode. Thus giving them the chance to only play through the excitement and frantic play that often encapsulates the last few games of the season. The Championship Moments mode, on the other hand is a little different in that it lets fans play through some of the greatest World Series moments throughout history in a type of simulation. This allows players to get directly on the inside of some of the games that changed the way America viewed baseball. The MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 2K5 WORLD SERIES EDITION is essentially the same great MLB game that comes out every year with a few bonus features, but those bonuses are well worth the money as they will easily pay for themselves with the hours of fun game play.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/major-league-baseball-2k5-world-series-edition"},{"id":18268,"cover":{"id":14530,"game":18268,"height":327,"image_id":"epigijpsuvom9zdt5u7m","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/epigijpsuvom9zdt5u7m.jpg","width":230,"checksum":"201b7b3f-4713-13da-d07f-c0c8d1e64790"},"first_release_date":1013904000,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":33632,"company":{"id":197,"description":"THQ Inc. is a leading worldwide developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software.

Turn 10 Studios began working on the original Forza Motorsport to fill the void of simulation racing games on the Xbox console. With an emphasis on driving mechanics and the newest features of Xbox LIVE, the original Forza Motorsport was released in May of 2005 to much critical acclaim and community support. \n \nBuilding off its success, Turn 10’s team immediately began working on a sequel intended to be released on Microsoft’s new Xbox 360 console. Forza Motorsport 2 was released in May of 2007, pushing the boundaries of User Generated Content (UGC) with a robust livery editor and online Auction House, giving casual players new options for expressing their creativity on and off the track. With new online tools, the Forza community thrived as painters, tuners, seller, and racers shared their creations via Forzamotorsport.net. \n \nIn late 2007, Turn 10 Studios began an intense development process for the next Forza installment. Our most ambitious project to date, Forza Motorsport 3 boasted enhanced graphics, driving physics, and UGC. Turn 10 released the game in October 2009 to critical and commercial success. \n \nReleased in October of 2011, Forza Motorsport 4 brought even more excitement to the franchise with Kinect integration, including the stunning Autovista experience. With hundreds of cars rendered in stunning detail, and new tracks to hone skills on, Forza Motorsport 4 was another resounding success for Turn 10 Studios. \n \nWith Forza Horizon, the Forza universe expanded to the open road. Action racing put the player in an open world that demands driving skill and rewards driving style. With lots to explore and a cutting-edge soundtrack to compliment the scenery, Horizon was an evolution of the authentic Forza experience. \n \nIn 2013, Turn 10 released Forza Motorsport 5, the first Forza Motorsport game to appear on the newest Xbox console, Xbox One. Featuring astonishing graphics and cutting-edge features like cloud-powered Drivatar opponents, Forza Motorsport 5 is a landmark racing game that defined the next generation of consoles and continues to appeal to Xbox fans across the world. \n \nForza Horizon 2 was released in 2014, featuring the wide-open spaces of Southern Europe to explore in hundreds of realistic, real-world cars. With a full day-night cycle and dramatic weather effects, Forza Horizon 2 was hailed by fans and critics alike for its beautiful visuals and emphasis on pure fun. In March 2015, Turn 10 released Forza Horizon 2 Presents Fast & Furious, a standalone expansion for Forza Horizon 2, inspired by the Fast & Furious film series and featuring many of the cars from Universal’s blockbuster action film, Furious 7.","logo":{"id":822,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":182,"image_id":"qtkg089mtfwctcvn480m","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qtkg089mtfwctcvn480m.jpg","width":190,"checksum":"29a39c06-ec4e-e40e-fc75-fae3c5b0a75e"},"name":"Turn 10 Studios","slug":"turn-10-studios"}},{"id":7791,"company":{"id":53,"logo":{"id":1668,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":330,"image_id":"nbgp6nfrvm9j7zr5uarc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nbgp6nfrvm9j7zr5uarc.jpg","width":630,"checksum":"3733e071-0952-63c3-27d2-4a2e71e4ac01"},"name":"Microsoft Game Studios","slug":"microsoft-game-studios"}}],"name":"Forza Motorsport","platforms":[11],"rating":83.12290679193231,"rating_count":15,"release_dates":[{"id":6767,"category":0,"created_at":1382227200,"date":1083542400,"game":3073,"human":"May 03, 2004","m":5,"platform":11,"region":8,"updated_at":1382227200,"y":2004,"checksum":"2d09d77c-cd4b-0269-7cdc-6afba2714481"}],"slug":"forza-motorsport","summary":"Racing sim from Microsoft, targeted at gamers who are passionate about cars and racing.

The Dreamcast version's distinguishing feature was that during the game's development, GunValkyrie utilized a unique control scheme using both a light gun and a controller. This control scheme was dropped when development shifted to the Xbox version. \n \nThe gameplay is very different from most third-person shooters, due to a unique dual analog control scheme, which is the main contributor to the steep learning curve of the game. Players travel to various worlds investigating the disappearance of several colonies, with only giant mutated insect creatures left behind. These insects comprise the bulk of the enemies you face along the way. \n \nPlayers control Kelly or Saburouta with both analog sticks, the left controlling forward/backward movement and turning, while the right aims their weapons, and when clicked, allows quick-turns. Clicking in the left stick while pointing in a direction causes the character to boost. The left trigger is a boost/jump, and when combined with the left analog boost, can be strung together into combos to keep the player off the ground entirely, which is a necessity for some levels. Face buttons are used to select weapons, and the right trigger fires the selected weapon. \n \nThe game comprises ten levels, the story unfolding via text between levels, or the occasional in-game cutscene. At the beginning of most levels, excluding boss battles, you have the choice of picking either Kelly or Saburouta. Kelly's primary weapon is fast but weaker, and she's overall faster and more maneuverable. Saburouta is slower, has more limited maneuverability in the air, and carries a stronger primary weapon, the Matchlock Cannon. Basically the two characters make up the two difficulty settings, with Kelly being the \"Normal\", and Saburouta being the \"Advanced\" setting. The real difference being that Kelly's style allowed several lock-on targets, while Saburouta's weapon splashed and was aimed at specific targets. Because of this, Kelly's gameplay is more frantic and requires less direct focus, while Saburota required specific aiming and direct attacks to be effective. Kelly is also the only character to upgrade her gearskin. \n \nThe artistic style of the game is similar to the steampunk subgenre of fiction, but the game's designers prefer to call it \"elec-punk,\" described as a step even further, with the harnessing of electricity for imaginative new uses. The game's stages are divided into indoor mechanical looking levels, with lots of gears and ornate metalwork, and outdoor stages, set in very organic looking valley's, craters, and other fantastic otherworldly locations.","total_rating":51,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gunvalkyrie"},{"id":6257,"collection":{"id":679,"created_at":1390608000,"games":[2285,4630,6257,6697,6698,20043,21680,21945,27093],"name":"Yu-Gi-Oh","slug":"yu-gi-oh","updated_at":1390608000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/yu-gi-oh","checksum":"4938114e-ff86-108c-63a3-dcbc5255090e"},"cover":{"id":6423,"game":6257,"height":268,"image_id":"dlqcgpxo9dci3h4oavob","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dlqcgpxo9dci3h4oavob.jpg","width":188,"checksum":"2d381732-2817-15d8-9666-b43efeb0b1b8"},"first_release_date":1080000000,"franchises":[{"id":57,"created_at":1372464000,"games":[2285,4108,4582,4630,6257,6697,6698,6699,11672,23467,26893,27093,43617,49377,49379,50002,50833,50834,51279,56977,56978,56980,57150,78163,78165,78166,78167,103288,105056,114905],"name":"Yu-Gi-Oh!","slug":"yu-gi-oh","updated_at":1372464000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/yu-gi-oh","checksum":"b22a6356-1cff-4f35-1a21-9038a03ee369"}],"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":16,"created_at":1297641600,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","slug":"turn-based-strategy-tbs","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/turn-based-strategy-tbs","checksum":"af5d3ecd-2ebd-358b-70df-e9204b9761be"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":14903,"company":{"id":129,"description":"Konami Holdings Corporation, commonly referred to as Konami, is a Japanese entertainment and gaming conglomerate.

Shortly thereafter, Take-Two announced that Global Star's products would henceforth be sold exclusively through their Jack of All Games' sales force to strengthen the company's position in the value-priced product category.

The game was released in North America on February 28, 2002 for the Xbox console. \n \nTapout was published by Crave Entertainment and developed by DreamFactory. The subtitle Tapout refers to a fighter tapping his hand indicating that he has submitted to a submission hold. A tapout, along with a knockout, judge's decision, and referee stoppage, is one of the ways of ending a UFC bout. \n \nThe game features many of UFC's top stars including Matt Hughes, Chuck Liddell, Mark Coleman, Frank Shamrock, and Tito Ortiz. Competitions can take place in several modes such as exhibition, tournament, arcade, and championship mode. Several fighters throughout the game are unlockable such as two female competitors and celebrity Ice-T. \n \nUFC: Tapout received generally lukewarm reviews from critics. A sequel to this game entitled UFC: Tapout 2 was released in 2003. Other than an updated roster, the game is very similar to the first Tapout and received similar reviews. Tapout 2 was published by TDK Mediactive.

It was developed by EA Tiburon and released on August 31, 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox and on September 4, 2004 for the GameCube. NASCAR 2005 is the first game in the series to drop the word Thunder from the title since NASCAR 2001. Kevin Harvick, driver of the #29 GM Goodwrench Chevy Monte Carlo, appeared on the cover. It also marks the first time the original PlayStation has been excluded from the NASCAR lineup. This was the first NASCAR edition to be released exclusively on six generation home consoles. \n \nUnlike previous entries, which would normally add a few extra features but leave most of the game identical to its predecessor, the game brought massive change to the series. One example is the inclusion of NASCAR series other than the NEXTEL Cup Series; the National Series (Busch Series), the Craftsman Truck Series, and the Featherlite Modified Series, plus muscle cars. More examples include the implementation of NASCAR's new Chase for the Cup points system, and Fight to the Top mode, where the player controls a custom driver throughout his career starting in the lower series and working up the ladder (similar to NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona). Another change is the absence of the cockpit view and the absence of makes and models in the Truck series, all of which appear to be Ford F-150s. Also due to failed negotiations Pocono Raceway is not included. This was the last NASCAR game released for the Nintendo GameCube.

The game takes place inside Butcher Bay, a maximum-security prison from which no prisoner has escaped. The facility—constructed on a barren planet—contains three increasingly secure holding areas, and a subterranean mining operation. \n \nThe game's protagonist is Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel), a murderer recently confined in Butcher Bay. Riddick is resourceful, and seeks to break out of the prison by any means necessary. His capturer is the bounty hunter William J. Johns (Cole Hauser); the two have had previous encounters.[6] Butcher Bay's warden is a man named Hoxie (Dwight Schultz), while Abbott (Xzibit) is a prison guard disliked by the inmates. The inmate Pope Joe (Willis Burks II) is an insane old man, who lives in the sewer tunnels beneath the prison.","total_rating":86.82455472782365,"total_rating_count":87,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-chronicles-of-riddick-escape-from-butcher-bay"},{"id":78622,"collection":{"id":846,"created_at":1396483200,"games":[5845,6526,11757,11758,11759,63642,78622,107292],"name":"Onimusha","slug":"onimusha","updated_at":1396483200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/onimusha","checksum":"04b06108-9f67-2681-d1fd-623939a19bb0"},"cover":{"id":55375,"game":78622,"height":1912,"image_id":"reaar7fuzuxvjcyenxni","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/reaar7fuzuxvjcyenxni.jpg","width":1521,"checksum":"1eccd7b2-fd7f-29f0-9892-56f580bad4cd"},"first_release_date":1012176000,"genres":[{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Genma Onimusha","platforms":[11],"release_dates":[{"id":168533,"category":0,"created_at":1555804800,"date":1012176000,"game":78622,"human":"Jan 28, 2002","m":1,"platform":11,"region":2,"updated_at":1555804800,"y":2002,"checksum":"458120c5-b6d1-b2a3-7449-66b42bd88117"},{"id":168534,"category":0,"created_at":1555804800,"date":1014336000,"game":78622,"human":"Feb 22, 2002","m":2,"platform":11,"region":5,"updated_at":1555804800,"y":2002,"checksum":"c753540c-9eb5-7625-e2fc-58fcede9f357"},{"id":168535,"category":0,"created_at":1555804800,"date":1016755200,"game":78622,"human":"Mar 22, 2002","m":3,"platform":11,"region":1,"updated_at":1555804800,"y":2002,"checksum":"d03e69f0-0ac1-f4ff-97d1-97dedea2ddf7"}],"slug":"genma-onimusha","summary":"Genma Onimusha is the Xbox port for Onimusha: Warlords, released in 2002.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/genma-onimusha"},{"id":18735,"collection":{"id":783,"created_at":1392076800,"games":[5317,5617,5972,5974,6782,6878,7122,7385,7558,15540,17249,18735,19507,21000,21466,21569,48929,65046],"name":"Ninja Gaiden","slug":"ninja-gaiden","updated_at":1392076800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/ninja-gaiden","checksum":"6b4264f0-b817-d382-d0be-16890804f717"},"cover":{"id":15061,"game":18735,"height":500,"image_id":"wfddvjrr1dlwmrnwhe2x","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wfddvjrr1dlwmrnwhe2x.jpg","width":354,"checksum":"cfae554a-c019-8af6-d6ba-4d936313b43d"},"first_release_date":1127174400,"genres":[{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":34610,"company":{"id":769,"logo":{"id":105,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":120,"image_id":"hhtghiazexa5izu6usbu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hhtghiazexa5izu6usbu.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"b09c64ad-e7fc-f7e9-50f7-bc8105f5f0f9"},"name":"Team Ninja","slug":"team-ninja"}},{"id":95621,"company":{"id":14776,"name":"Tecmo","slug":"tecmo"}}],"name":"Ninja Gaiden Black","platforms":[11],"rating":93.38371277900761,"rating_count":25,"release_dates":[{"id":49652,"category":0,"created_at":1460505600,"date":1127174400,"game":18735,"human":"Sep 20, 2005","m":9,"platform":11,"region":2,"updated_at":1460505600,"y":2005,"checksum":"93ed26ca-691e-770d-abbc-2b2f480d0b9f"}],"screenshots":[{"id":22607,"game":18735,"height":450,"image_id":"vswu9kbcc6hbcsm5z47m","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vswu9kbcc6hbcsm5z47m.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"c0bf8166-dca6-5d8e-ffcf-d0a2d1ea940b"},{"id":22608,"game":18735,"height":480,"image_id":"ahueg2h7hhwodi3caxei","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ahueg2h7hhwodi3caxei.jpg","width":720,"checksum":"a79b6416-c492-5bfc-d3a3-5ae8763ab042"}],"slug":"ninja-gaiden-black","summary":"In Ninja Gaiden Black you can reprise the role of Ryu Hayabusa, ninja extraordinaire.

As players' characters develop, the world reacts to them and their actions. People comment on their successes, failures, appearances and behaviors. Their many opinions are expressed through applause, mockery, trepidation, panic and even flirtation. With each person characters aid and every creature they slay, the world is changed forever.

They proved to be his doom, however, as the World of Martial Arts is nothing if not unkind to those without the power to protect what is theirs. \n \nCombatants choose from 10 character models, each of which has 2 variations. There are also a variety of monster and undead models that can be used. Each character has different configurations of strength, speed and health, affecting their performance in a fight. These characters are combined with weapons (sometimes pre-selected, sometimes grabbed in a free-for-all during a fight) to allow for a wide variety of play styles. \n \nThe weapons are: Phoenix Wings (Hand Blades), Searing Dagger, Ember Sword (Longsword), Phoenix Tail (Long Spear), Ash Blade (Scimitar), Meteor Hammer, Flame of Heaven (2-Handed Sword), Phoenix Talons (Hand Claws), and the Feather Blade (Ninja-to sword). Players can also pick up a variety of darts which can poison or slow a target, in addition there is a variety of equipment that can grand special powers, such as increased strength, invisibility, and movement. \n \nMovement in the game is based in the wire-fu, with leaps, flips, wall-running, etc. A move power meter governs this aspect of play, recharging over time. \n \nThe game is all-combat, all the time, either single player or Xbox Live. Single players can go up against a custom build out of bots, in a variety of game modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, VIP, Giant Kill, and Challenge Ring. These modes are available online as well, allowing up to 16 simultaneous players to engage in high-flying martial arts battles with exotic weaponry on Xbox Live.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/iron-phoenix"},{"id":5961,"collection":{"id":4517,"created_at":1512777600,"games":[5961,5962,24094,68305],"name":"NFL Fever","slug":"nfl-fever","updated_at":1512777600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/nfl-fever","checksum":"1b8a34ae-112a-73a9-5827-657c7ec43c84"},"cover":{"id":6148,"game":5961,"height":288,"image_id":"zoi218ugxkaxixbkkrks","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zoi218ugxkaxixbkkrks.jpg","width":200,"checksum":"825503d8-4f82-8f7a-2f95-44216ed4be06"},"first_release_date":1005782400,"franchises":[{"id":224,"created_at":1390348800,"games":[812,4040,4041,4042,4828,4983,4984,4985,4986,4987,4988,5673,5961,5962,5963,7118,7882,8842,8843,8846,19463,19807,25080,46414,102122,114286,132707],"name":"NFL","slug":"nfl","updated_at":1390348800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/nfl","checksum":"89deb383-30a8-565d-72c1-6ec5fa3b77ae"}],"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":14326,"company":{"id":53,"logo":{"id":1668,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":330,"image_id":"nbgp6nfrvm9j7zr5uarc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nbgp6nfrvm9j7zr5uarc.jpg","width":630,"checksum":"3733e071-0952-63c3-27d2-4a2e71e4ac01"},"name":"Microsoft Game Studios","slug":"microsoft-game-studios"}}],"name":"NFL Fever 2002","platforms":[11],"release_dates":[{"id":14626,"category":0,"created_at":1396742400,"date":1005782400,"game":5961,"human":"Nov 15, 2001","m":11,"platform":11,"region":8,"updated_at":1396742400,"y":2001,"checksum":"0dad06dd-9919-07d3-e351-c348df7e79b3"}],"slug":"nfl-fever-2002","summary":"NFL Fever 2002 is an American Football video game published and developed by Microsoft Game Studios.

Although controlled by Take-Two, the company remained intact and published games using its own logo as a publishing label.\n\nIn 2002 Global Star Software launched its Global ProBiz lineup of over a dozen business and utility products. Global Star also continued its efforts in the PDA software market, spearheading new initiatives such as multi-platform releases for both Palm and Pocket PC devices.\n\nBy the end of 2002, Global Star was reorganized and became a division of Take-Two's Jack of All Games' Canadian operations along with Triad Distributors. Shortly thereafter, Take-Two announced that Global Star's products would henceforth be sold exclusively through their Jack of All Games' sales force to strengthen the company's position in the value-priced product category. In mid 2003 Global Star Software, Inc. was formed and all distribution operations were consolidated operationally into the new company located within the Take-Two corporate facilities in New York City.\n\nThe Global Star Software label was absorbed into the 2K Play label when Take-Two announced its formation on 10th September 2007.\"","logo":{"id":756,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":300,"image_id":"cmkshjwshjxzpfbw7qwt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cmkshjwshjxzpfbw7qwt.jpg","width":400,"checksum":"31bc4864-9826-883e-65b1-ed3acd3572fb"},"name":"Global Star Software","slug":"global-star-software"}},{"id":13878,"company":{"id":690,"description":"Torus Games is the most prolific independent game developer in the world.
