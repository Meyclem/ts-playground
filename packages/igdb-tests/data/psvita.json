However, in the year after the device's successful launch, sales of the hardware and its bigger budget games stalled, threatening to end its lifespan. A concentrated effort to attract smaller, indie developers in the West, combined with strong support from mid-level Japanese companies, helped keep the platform afloat. While this led to less diversity in its game library, it did garner strong support in Japanese-developed role-playing video games and visual novels alongside a wealth of Western-developed indie games, leading it to become a moderate seller in Japan, and build a smaller, yet passionate userbase in the West. In the platform's later years, Sony also promoted its ability to work in conjunction with its other gaming products, notably the ability to play PlayStation 4 games on it through the process of Remote Play, similar to the Wii U's function of Off-TV Play.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/platforms/psvita/version/playstation-vita","checksum":"2a3fe13d-1fab-ba3d-987c-7e3a8894b6b1"},{"id":274,"connectivity":"IEEE 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 2.1+EDR","cpu":"ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore","graphics":"PowerVR SGX543MP4+","media":"PlayStation Vita Game Card, digital distribution","memory":"512 MB RAM, 128 MB VRAM","name":"PlayStation Vita (PCH-2000)","online":"PlayStation Network","os":"PlayStation Vita system software","platform_logo":215,"platform_version_release_dates":[{"id":326,"category":0,"date":1399334400,"human":"May 06, 2014","m":5,"region":2,"y":2014,"checksum":"e54c87e4-ae8a-618c-1d1e-cbd1fe37e383"},{"id":327,"category":0,"date":1391731200,"human":"Feb 07, 2014","m":2,"region":1,"y":2014,"checksum":"59f70045-a1fe-e02c-7d30-ad3a8f88282c"},{"id":328,"category":0,"date":1381363200,"human":"Oct 10, 2013","m":10,"region":5,"y":2013,"checksum":"fee4913d-c6b6-2b8d-5e4b-4586f48dd9a1"}],"resolutions":"960 x 544","slug":"playstation-vita-pch-2000","sound":"Stereo speakers, 3.5 mm headphone jack, Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR","storage":"1GB internal flash memory, PlayStation Vita Memory Card (4GB, 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB)","summary":"The revised model, officially called the PCH-2000 series and commonly referred to as the PS Vita Slim, is 20% thinner and 15% lighter compared to the original model.

Upon defeating a monster girl, you’ll get to recruit them through its touchscreen \"scratching\" feature. There are also some items that will allow you to get them to join you later without having to do the scratch feature.

It was relocated and reincorporated on July 12, 1993. Since then Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. has grown into an international company focused on creating video game products across modern console platforms. NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles.

Since then Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. has grown into an international company focused on creating video game products across modern console platforms. NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

Members of the team are known to be predominately female, but the structure has changed over the years to include male developers. The team's name is meant to highlight the female members since rubies are considered the \"queen of gems\" and represent passionate love. \n \nRuby Party also partakes or supervises the various media made based on their products such as the drama CDs, light novels, magazine publications, radio programs, live events, talk shows, comics, and anime. Select animated and comic adaptations have been localized overseas, but the games have largely remained in Japan —aside from a few rare exceptions. If enough interest arises for their games, there may be a chance someday they will be brought overseas and translated into English. \n \nAs of April 1, 2016, Ruby Party doubles as a brand name for the company's romantic simulations, merchandise, licenses for multimedia projects, and stage event management.

Since then Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. has grown into an international company focused on creating video game products across modern console platforms. NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus. The publisher has become a somewhat of a well-known presence in the North American market, having won RPGLand's \"Stateside Publisher of the Year Award\" in 2009.","logo":{"id":457,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":300,"image_id":"kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"04ccf3d2-0f38-8c2f-6104-b6941712aecc"},"name":"NIS America","slug":"nis-america"}}],"name":"Hyperdimension Neptunia PP: Producing Perfection","platforms":[46],"release_dates":[{"id":29109,"category":0,"created_at":1429488000,"date":1371772800,"game":9867,"human":"Jun 21, 2013","m":6,"platform":46,"region":7,"updated_at":1429488000,"y":2013,"checksum":"7cc7405a-c0b5-c3fe-2e5f-ccdc2d2b82b3"},{"id":29111,"category":0,"created_at":1429488000,"date":1401926400,"game":9867,"human":"Jun 05, 2014","m":6,"platform":46,"region":3,"updated_at":1429488000,"y":2014,"checksum":"3f3f8b79-b10b-eb09-01dc-f6b12d75bbc3"},{"id":103633,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1401753600,"game":9867,"human":"Jun 03, 2014","m":6,"platform":46,"region":2,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2014,"checksum":"91ca44c2-8c91-b286-d3eb-895dd19fe433"},{"id":103634,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1402012800,"game":9867,"human":"Jun 06, 2014","m":6,"platform":46,"region":1,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2014,"checksum":"1c1318d7-c1e9-f317-542b-2ea218844910"},{"id":122225,"category":0,"created_at":1508112000,"date":1371686400,"game":9867,"human":"Jun 20, 2013","m":6,"platform":46,"region":5,"updated_at":1508112000,"y":2013,"checksum":"135f46a7-63f9-49c4-69cd-e88919ebfadb"}],"screenshots":[{"id":11645,"game":9867,"height":283,"image_id":"zfb8ih8hryf2fqzhdkau","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zfb8ih8hryf2fqzhdkau.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"5edb3188-64d8-02e5-e2ee-9f134dd81f1b"},{"id":11646,"game":9867,"height":283,"image_id":"b8qatkctezj8ckp04sew","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b8qatkctezj8ckp04sew.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"15cdbcfb-e52e-fdb5-c5d9-f2927486d8f8"},{"id":11647,"game":9867,"height":283,"image_id":"cc5hhqf5id153eft2rdt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cc5hhqf5id153eft2rdt.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"3643dfe3-b906-670a-4611-1bf8be8dd14d"},{"id":11648,"game":9867,"height":283,"image_id":"fqiiou083a97qarxrmiq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fqiiou083a97qarxrmiq.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"dc80ce75-0c13-1cf7-40bd-bb8490233e78"},{"id":11649,"game":9867,"height":283,"image_id":"unuoiyhd0fn5xqhrbvia","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/unuoiyhd0fn5xqhrbvia.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"6fed6011-00b0-b5c2-d471-5fed8190d560"}],"slug":"hyperdimension-neptunia-pp-producing-perfection","summary":"You take on the role of the main character, who happens to fall into Gamindustri and is immediately hired by one of the four CPUs-Neptune, Noire, Blanc, and Vert-to be their producer and manage their idol careers.

It largely depicts various social situations faced by teens in a high school setting and the psychology driving their interactions.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/yahari-game-demo-ore-no-seishun-love-come-wa-machigatteiru"},{"id":53032,"cover":{"id":29166,"game":53032,"height":514,"image_id":"pdxmsssslpzjmozgijzh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pdxmsssslpzjmozgijzh.jpg","width":960,"checksum":"19e1c324-59a2-6e29-05ed-1cc4072b1ae7"},"first_release_date":1381276800,"involved_companies":[{"id":98300,"company":{"id":16437,"logo":{"id":3437,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":400,"image_id":"cl2nh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cl2nh.jpg","width":400,"checksum":"d67ac7d9-715f-c498-ab04-08e256645353"},"name":"Team17","slug":"team17"}}],"name":"Worms: Revolution Extreme","platforms":[46],"release_dates":[{"id":185612,"category":0,"created_at":1579132800,"date":1381276800,"game":53032,"human":"Oct 09, 2013","m":10,"platform":46,"region":8,"updated_at":1579132800,"y":2013,"checksum":"5dd0ce52-6f22-24cd-b80d-e2b10d0b4ad9"}],"screenshots":[{"id":117328,"game":53032,"height":408,"image_id":"xddukggivajbhksagdmj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xddukggivajbhksagdmj.jpg","width":720,"checksum":"9dbb625c-cc0d-361e-b0a9-49c0a9aaed8f"},{"id":117329,"game":53032,"height":408,"image_id":"w35enidrzuwlkixvwhbz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w35enidrzuwlkixvwhbz.jpg","width":720,"checksum":"0c5e1d45-eed1-4667-2e84-226dd1fcbbda"},{"id":117330,"game":53032,"height":408,"image_id":"aawacpkg9xzslgy4fivu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aawacpkg9xzslgy4fivu.jpg","width":720,"checksum":"9a7d0011-ae25-51eb-2120-975d5602bca4"},{"id":117331,"game":53032,"height":408,"image_id":"cknnmqdu8crd3uvxscqh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cknnmqdu8crd3uvxscqh.jpg","width":720,"checksum":"d22e304c-193c-8c4e-e749-42d32419121e"},{"id":117332,"game":53032,"height":408,"image_id":"yrcz37kdrvbf8why167w","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yrcz37kdrvbf8why167w.jpg","width":720,"checksum":"e7360c74-76eb-9b9c-07ef-5fc6028607f9"}],"slug":"worms-revolution-extreme","summary":"Worms™ Revolution Extreme is the first game in the classic turn-based strategy series to come to the PlayStation®Vita, featuring exciting new features and beautiful 3D graphics whilst retaining the classic 2D gameplay that fans love.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/worms-revolution-extreme"},{"id":23417,"cover":{"id":25878,"game":23417,"height":1024,"image_id":"anuqint3uo87oyobtr7y","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/anuqint3uo87oyobtr7y.jpg","width":802,"checksum":"cdff0f16-8d35-b777-5c91-abd53a8e04bc"},"first_release_date":1395964800,"involved_companies":[{"id":63087,"company":{"id":13634,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment","slug":"sony-computer-entertainment"}}],"name":"Invizimals: The Alliance","platforms":[46],"release_dates":[{"id":90028,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":1414627200,"game":23417,"human":"Oct 30, 2014","m":10,"platform":46,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":2014,"checksum":"cd98e5f7-7576-29f8-e78f-44e877786ee5"},{"id":103699,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1395964800,"game":23417,"human":"Mar 28, 2014","m":3,"platform":46,"region":1,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2014,"checksum":"4024e7a5-357c-d264-bd1a-c968eee2712b"}],"screenshots":[{"id":115946,"game":23417,"height":180,"image_id":"m50338qoujfzrb20gq2h","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m50338qoujfzrb20gq2h.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"32e78da5-0ce5-07a4-6f6b-f4406aa32cee"},{"id":115947,"game":23417,"height":544,"image_id":"ls4m0kqmvopvvm0ovzpm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ls4m0kqmvopvvm0ovzpm.jpg","width":960,"checksum":"a3b45342-a7ce-7ae5-f1d9-621e636ffe66"},{"id":115948,"game":23417,"height":544,"image_id":"b52sr9xyv39bkmkvozmn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b52sr9xyv39bkmkvozmn.jpg","width":960,"checksum":"e0b9f538-e739-ee20-aeeb-16c7d5615719"},{"id":115949,"game":23417,"height":544,"image_id":"yirpi9yn2bfqinp6ze2a","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yirpi9yn2bfqinp6ze2a.jpg","width":960,"checksum":"f08e75e8-4bf6-1152-e0ea-d3a87b8d59db"},{"id":115950,"game":23417,"height":544,"image_id":"jvwyb01nz1xri9f5h21m","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jvwyb01nz1xri9f5h21m.jpg","width":960,"checksum":"8db57355-2336-3d5d-48b9-e7f75aecacbe"}],"slug":"invizimals-the-alliance","summary":"Get ready for some fun on the run as the hunt for Invizimals goes anywhere and everywhere.

Members of the team are known to be predominately female, but the structure has changed over the years to include male developers. The team's name is meant to highlight the female members since rubies are considered the \"queen of gems\" and represent passionate love. \n \nRuby Party also partakes or supervises the various media made based on their products such as the drama CDs, light novels, magazine publications, radio programs, live events, talk shows, comics, and anime. Select animated and comic adaptations have been localized overseas, but the games have largely remained in Japan —aside from a few rare exceptions. If enough interest arises for their games, there may be a chance someday they will be brought overseas and translated into English. \n \nAs of April 1, 2016, Ruby Party doubles as a brand name for the company's romantic simulations, merchandise, licenses for multimedia projects, and stage event management. Mei Erikawa, Kou Shibusawa and Keiko Erikawa's eldest daughter, is the director for the Ruby Party brand.","logo":{"id":1479,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":129,"image_id":"v24kbldfuqvpqp2dppvk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v24kbldfuqvpqp2dppvk.jpg","width":301,"checksum":"110c9fe4-e8c3-d84d-0f65-f17fd77d5fb2"},"name":"Ruby Party","slug":"ruby-party"}},{"id":104145,"company":{"id":18532,"name":"Koei Tecmo","slug":"koei-tecmo"}}],"name":"Geten no Hana with Yume Akari Collector's Edition","platforms":[46],"release_dates":[{"id":204435,"category":0,"created_at":1594857600,"date":1473292800,"game":135857,"human":"Sep 08, 2016","m":9,"platform":46,"region":5,"updated_at":1594857600,"y":2016,"checksum":"57f2c3aa-4f3c-fc01-60b5-d92850c58855"}],"slug":"geten-no-hana-with-yume-akari-collectors-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/geten-no-hana-with-yume-akari-collectors-edition"},{"id":11752,"collection":{"id":3045,"created_at":1506556800,"games":[11752,70827,79051],"name":"Ugoku Manga Digicoro","slug":"ugoku-manga-digicoro","updated_at":1506556800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/ugoku-manga-digicoro","checksum":"161b3fba-97b0-2b4c-5b73-fac238f0d1dc"},"cover":{"id":81622,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":11752,"height":996,"image_id":"co1qza","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1qza.jpg","width":738,"checksum":"719235f1-6a0c-f1cd-5e63-a574eb904bae"},"first_release_date":1477526400,"franchises":[{"id":602,"created_at":1440115200,"games":[11741,11752,77499],"name":"Yahari Ore no Seishun Rabu Kome wa Machigatteiru.","slug":"yahari-ore-no-seishun-rabu-kome-wa-machigatteiru","updated_at":1440115200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/yahari-ore-no-seishun-rabu-kome-wa-machigatteiru","checksum":"0c598600-70cb-037e-de40-9fbace37d576"}],"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"},{"id":34,"created_at":1571788800,"name":"Visual Novel","slug":"visual-novel","updated_at":1571788800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/visual-novel","checksum":"137fe5c7-e4bc-1c30-4c7c-54596b47448f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":25505,"company":{"id":2428,"description":"Five Powered &amp; basics","logo":{"id":116,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":40,"image_id":"daqw6lgqxyw5pkv1bziw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/daqw6lgqxyw5pkv1bziw.jpg","width":200,"checksum":"7fa4743e-fa60-594a-c9a0-a0ab66a3cad6"},"name":"5pb.","slug":"5pb"}},{"id":84678,"company":{"id":6229,"description":"Developer of portable games based on light novels and anime.","logo":{"id":3089,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":20,"image_id":"cl2dt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cl2dt.jpg","width":145,"checksum":"6912c2fb-01f2-783f-4057-0d2b74ead23f"},"name":"guyzware","slug":"guyzware"}}],"name":"Yahari Game demo Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru.

world has gone through many Dusks, and is slowly nearing its end. Within this world, in the western reaches of the \"Land of Dusk,\" there was a nation that prospered thanks to its use of alchemy. There, in order to survive the eventual arrival of the \"Dusk End,\" the people devoted their efforts to rediscover and recreate lost alchemic technologies. Rediscovered technology from the past era was gathered in the alchemy research city known as \"Central,\" where research was conducted on how to halt the advance of the twilight. One of the heroes is a young man who researched alchemy in Central, the other a girl living in a small town on the frontier. This girl's name is Escha.

Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

The storyline continues from after the events of Persona 4, when the teenage mega-idol, Rise Kujikawa, returns to the city to re-take her show biz career. During that time, a strange video appears on the internet and the unfortunate people who watched it have gone missing! Members of Kanamin Kitchen, Rise's junior idol group, have disappeared and it's up to the Investigation team to mount a rescue mission - only they discover the same monstrous Shadows from the Midnight Channel. To make matters even worse, their Persona abilities are rendered ineffective, and the Shadows in P4D can only be defeated by dance, so bust out powerful dance moves to save the day! \n \n \nPersona 4: Dancing All Night Disco Fever Edition Includes: \nPersona 4: Dancing All Night Game \nPersona 4: Dancing All Night Vita Pouch \nTwo CDs of Shoji Meguro's Music from Persona 4: Dancing All Night \nTeddie Keychain (North American Exclusive) \nExclusive Persona 4 themed PS Vita Skin \n10 Persona 4: Dancing All Night Wallpapers \nTwo Sets of DLC Outfits \nBonus Playable Song - Never More \nCollectible Outer Box","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/persona-4-dancing-all-night-disco-fever-edition"},{"id":19907,"collection":{"id":281,"created_at":1346544000,"games":[1278,3205,3206,19907,22885,45291],"name":"Resistance","slug":"resistance","updated_at":1346544000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/resistance","checksum":"769d61fd-39cc-2e31-3d93-2c06a11b31f1"},"cover":{"id":107724,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":19907,"height":952,"image_id":"co2b4c","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2b4c.jpg","width":714,"checksum":"8ccc08f0-3053-96fc-56d2-345a70a23a76"},"first_release_date":1338249600,"franchises":[{"id":2109,"created_at":1596672000,"name":"Resistance","slug":"resistance","updated_at":1596672000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/resistance","checksum":"1e148218-97d5-21ba-5e07-04211f50a03a"}],"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":105328,"company":{"id":45,"logo":{"id":885,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":1024,"image_id":"djkfinra1pds0bnz83gt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/djkfinra1pds0bnz83gt.jpg","width":711,"checksum":"e3824481-0a57-aea1-a73b-f6eafe351b26"},"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.

If the idea of playing without your friends sounds horrifying, the game will include 4-player co-cop play. \n \nThe title takes place on Planet Machia, a planet where 'Photon' energy is useless. Without the ability to recover energy or upgrade your weapons, players must take survival into their own hands, exploring the planet of Machia and unlocking the secrets it has to offer. \n \nThe creatures inhabiting Machia are giant beasts appropriately named 'Gigantes.' In order to take these massive brutes down, you'll need to find and hit their weak spots together with your allies. \n \nSega also implemented tweaks based off the Phantasy Star Nova battle demo into the game. After the first demo, tri-Ace increased character movement speed by 1.4x, reduced input delay, fixed issues with locking on to enemies, and fine tuned the speed of the camera, among other improvements.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/phantasy-star-nova"}]}
