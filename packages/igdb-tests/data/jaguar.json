The World Cup tournament is featured in full, and you can adjust which 24 teams this features, a particularly crucial feature for English and French fans, as their nations failed to qualify. For the first time in the series an on-screen referee is featured. The club team data has been updated to take into account transfers and kit changes since the previous version. Gameplay is much the same as previous editions, being viewed from above with small sprites and loose ball control.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/international-sensible-soccer"},{"id":40827,"collection":{"id":4977,"created_at":1512864000,"games":[22460,40827,51182],"name":"Iron Soldier","slug":"iron-soldier","updated_at":1512864000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/iron-soldier","checksum":"4d5cbdd4-6711-3296-1a04-cdeb818ff9f1"},"cover":{"id":79372,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":40827,"height":1598,"image_id":"co1p8s","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1p8s.jpg","width":1199,"checksum":"a7dd1551-568f-03ab-b4c4-f3f0346e13cc"},"first_release_date":867369600,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"name":"Iron Soldier 2","platforms":[62],"release_dates":[{"id":91626,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":867369600,"game":40827,"human":"Jun 27, 1997","m":6,"platform":62,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1997,"checksum":"37cf8d08-e418-ba19-044e-627d53a0d679"}],"slug":"iron-soldier-2","summary":"Iron Soldier 2 is a first-person 3D giant mech game. Players must pilot their building-sized robots in a variety of missions ranging from search-and-destroy to surgical attacks to defending objectives. Starting with a limited set of weapons, players can collect more armaments throughout the game. Each weapon can be mounted on a certain part of the robot's body, but once mounted, no other weapons can be placed there. So, while there is a wide range of weapon configurations, not every weapon can be combined with others. Players can destroy buildings in levels to find crates containing new weapons and extra ammunition for current weapons.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/iron-soldier-2"},{"id":40822,"cover":{"id":26436,"game":40822,"height":2100,"image_id":"pxmgd6atx3zyut0oqslz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pxmgd6atx3zyut0oqslz.jpg","width":1521,"checksum":"7451454b-d76c-586b-bd41-992bcaae1ae3"},"first_release_date":791596800,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"name":"Ultra Vortek","platforms":[62],"release_dates":[{"id":91614,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":791596800,"game":40822,"human":"Feb 01, 1995","m":2,"platform":62,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1995,"checksum":"ced38173-0e0c-951b-4f51-8c93e50e934b"}],"slug":"ultra-vortek","summary":"Mankind must prove that it is worthy of the powers of the Ultra Vortek -- the eternal energy source for all life on Earth.
