By blasting subatomic foes with your Vitamin Beam, utilizing a special claw tool, and navigating maze-like stages, you’ll save the members of the Sable family — including the dog! — from a variety of hazardous and increasingly wacky predicaments. Each level also includes sub-games featuring rhythm challenges, Pong-like reflex tests, and more. \n \nWhile the entire game can be played solo, Vitamin Connection also features an innovative, asymmetrical local two-player co-op mode, in which one player controls the Capsule Ship’s movement and shooting, while the other handles the ship’s rotation and aiming.

Luckily he has some great tools at his disposal, including the Telewarp, Freeze-o-Matic and InstantRock™. \n \nCreative thinking and problem solving are required to collect all eggs in each level, but don’t worry! When you get stuck, you can always rewind time. And if all else fails, use the Wildcard to skip a level. \n \nToki Tori for Nintendo Switch is the most detailed portable version of the game so far. \n \nToki Tori 2+ \n \nExplore an enthralling forest island, learn magical songs and interact with the local wildlife to solve environmental puzzles. \n \nToki Tori 2+’s ingenious game design requires just two moves: whistle and stomp. It's super accessible, yet it builds up to incredible complexity later on. \n \nThere’s a tonne to do, too. After puzzle-solving your way to five Ancient Frogs and saving the island from a strange pollution, you can still find hundreds of golden wings, snap dozens of creature pictures and go Achievement hunting. \n \nToki Tori 2+ is better than ever on Nintendo Switch, with lots of gameplay tweaks and even some new secrets and puzzle solutions. Plus, you can now create checkpoints wherever you like, allowing for easy experimentation. \n \nEach purchase includes the following items: \n- Fully assembled Nintendo Switch game with cartridge \n- Interior art \n- Full-colour manual \n- Exclusive sticker \n- 3 card trading card pack \n \nLanguages Supported: English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese, Dutch, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese and Japanese ","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/toki-tori-collection"},{"id":57142,"cover":{"id":60492,"game":57142,"height":337,"image_id":"grb8qr74igpvo2afuszc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/grb8qr74igpvo2afuszc.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"a219eca7-0f21-f0a0-bbd2-8d85396079a6"},"first_release_date":1518048000,"genres":[{"id":7,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Music","slug":"music","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/music","checksum":"22d44a0d-89c7-580f-eef2-e06f178fdd47"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":54079,"company":{"id":6574,"name":"DMM.com","slug":"dmm-dot-com"}},{"id":65000,"company":{"id":2187,"description":"XSEED Games (officially Marvelous USA, Inc.) is a video game publishing, localization, and distribution company founded by former members of Square Enix USA and a subsidiary of the Japanese Marvelous group.

Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

Ichi Software was founded in September 1991 in Gifu Prefecture, Japan, as an entertainment software company. It was relocated and reincorporated on July 12, 1993. Since then Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. has grown into an international company focused on creating video game products across modern console platforms. NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus. The publisher has become a somewhat of a well-known presence in the North American market, having won RPGLand's \"Stateside Publisher of the Year Award\" in 2009.","logo":{"id":457,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":300,"image_id":"kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"04ccf3d2-0f38-8c2f-6104-b6941712aecc"},"name":"NIS America","slug":"nis-america"}},{"id":82924,"company":{"id":13178,"name":"City Connection","slug":"city-connection"}},{"id":82925,"company":{"id":2888,"name":"Psikyo","slug":"psikyo"}}],"name":"Psikyo Shooting Stars Bravo","platforms":[130],"release_dates":[{"id":174177,"category":0,"created_at":1565654400,"date":1567036800,"game":121652,"human":"Aug 29, 2019","m":8,"platform":130,"region":5,"updated_at":1565654400,"y":2019,"checksum":"451437ed-e7a4-3bfe-e0e5-72413df9ce24"},{"id":189242,"category":0,"created_at":1582070400,"date":1581984000,"game":121652,"human":"Feb 18, 2020","m":2,"platform":130,"region":2,"updated_at":1582156800,"y":2020,"checksum":"e1f20694-f78e-1a2e-07f8-ac6b2a7b15bd"},{"id":196629,"category":0,"created_at":1590019200,"date":1582243200,"game":121652,"human":"Feb 21, 2020","m":2,"platform":130,"region":1,"updated_at":1590019200,"y":2020,"checksum":"da1396ce-cfcf-c9d6-3fc1-0f99118b92c2"},{"id":196630,"category":0,"created_at":1590019200,"date":1582848000,"game":121652,"human":"Feb 28, 2020","m":2,"platform":130,"region":3,"updated_at":1590019200,"y":2020,"checksum":"ffe2ca0e-36d0-d92c-0798-6adfda67f99b"}],"slug":"psikyo-shooting-stars-bravo","summary":"Samurai Aces Episode I, Samurai Aces Episode II: TENGAI, Samurai Aces Episode III: SENGOKU CANNON, GUNBARICH, GUNBIRD, and GUNBIRD2 unite to form this epic arcade collection!

Our titles have received multiple prestigeous awards throughout the years including: Apple Design Award, Best of PAX and IGN Editor's Choice. \n \n- \n \nIt all started in 2009, when a bunch of veterans of polish gaming industry joined their forces and founded 11 bit studios. They gathered few talented people and got to work. After a year our first child was born – Anomaly Warzone Earth hit the stores. Quickly it became a huge success, with great sales and number of industry awards, including Apple Design Award. \n \nIt was a proof that we were on the right track and in the next few years we repeated the success with Anomaly 2, Anomaly Korea and few other games. But you know what they say – the more you have, the more you want so in 2012 we decided it was time for something bigger. \n \nFor the next two years we worked on our upcoming title. Bigger and better than ever before, but what’s even more important – a game that had a potential to touch people. A game that could matter. Something, that hasn’t been done before. A thing to be played and discussed for years to come. In the end of 2014 we were ready and our greatest achievement to this day had it’s premiere. On 14th of November This War of Mine had its release and everything had changed. \n \nThe cost of development were covered in first weekend after the premiere, and since then the game keeps being one of the topsellers on Steam and other distribution platforms. The game got over 100 awards and was covered as a phenomenon in the biggest magazines and newspapers all around the world including TIME, EDGE, Washington Post and more. \n \nThis brings us to the place where we are today. This War of Mine is still selling really well, being one of the most successful indie titles of the last decade. Our next big game, Frostpunk, is right around the corner and you know what? Again our guts are telling us it will leave a mark. We are crossing the borders and redefining the rules of the genre and that’s the road we want to follow. We believe in creating things instead of just copying them. \n \nSoon you’ll tell us if we achieved what we hoped for. In the meantime we are not slacking around – we started a publishing program that allows developers from all around the world to release their indie games with our help. The first games are already out there, so you should check them out. \n \nThat’s our story so far, but we are quite sure there is more to come. \n \n~ 11 bit studios","logo":{"id":1446,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":104,"image_id":"xqnocc8yxom38arqyrlq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xqnocc8yxom38arqyrlq.jpg","width":166,"checksum":"cdf4ad35-5b0d-1977-6b0a-ace657b3902d"},"name":"11 bit studios","slug":"11-bit-studios"}}],"name":"This War of Mine: Complete Edition","platforms":[130],"rating":70,"rating_count":1,"release_dates":[{"id":161501,"category":0,"created_at":1543104000,"date":1543276800,"game":111817,"human":"Nov 27, 2018","m":11,"platform":130,"region":8,"updated_at":1543190400,"y":2018,"checksum":"84b2eb08-b34c-203c-57cb-7e5bd932fd40"}],"screenshots":[{"id":268049,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":111817,"height":720,"image_id":"sc5qtt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5qtt.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"b4014a82-9401-affb-b9eb-51380047447f"},{"id":384409,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":111817,"height":450,"image_id":"sc88m1","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc88m1.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"dc87069c-2e06-bdb9-1245-cb27d40f3b81"},{"id":384410,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":111817,"height":450,"image_id":"sc88m2","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc88m2.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"1dacb4cb-fedc-b242-eb80-6e2091955df2"}],"slug":"this-war-of-mine-complete-edition","summary":"In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers.

In September 2003 the name was changed to Eden Games S.A.S.\n\nMost recently, the studio is known for the Alone in the Dark reboot (2008) and the Test Drive Unlimited series.","logo":{"id":518,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":1123,"image_id":"v7hmhtlczukg2rjofzsy","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v7hmhtlczukg2rjofzsy.jpg","width":775,"checksum":"7818f5a1-f1f7-8931-76cc-75085ea7b9d2"},"name":"Eden Games","slug":"eden-games"}},{"id":68960,"company":{"id":5283,"name":"Microids","slug":"microids"}}],"name":"Gear.Club Unlimited 2","platforms":[130],"rating":77,"rating_count":1,"release_dates":[{"id":159764,"category":0,"created_at":1539043200,"date":1543881600,"game":107196,"human":"Dec 04, 2018","m":12,"platform":130,"region":8,"updated_at":1539043200,"y":2018,"checksum":"2f7f1967-e98e-f8de-9117-04a28b9830ad"}],"screenshots":[{"id":266598,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":107196,"height":864,"image_id":"sc5ppi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5ppi.jpg","width":1536,"checksum":"4b7c63fe-7bde-063d-5ccd-a8c9a9bb7b90"},{"id":266599,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":107196,"height":864,"image_id":"sc5ppj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5ppj.jpg","width":1536,"checksum":"9ec07f00-853f-0ed7-ca5f-f351acfcf2d3"},{"id":266600,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":107196,"height":650,"image_id":"sc5ppk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5ppk.jpg","width":1600,"checksum":"6ed7c0b6-266b-730a-8239-e67da953bf2c"},{"id":266601,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":107196,"height":650,"image_id":"sc5ppl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5ppl.jpg","width":1600,"checksum":"5903f65c-6ac9-3f0e-4aa4-8ab17938a8ae"},{"id":266602,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":107196,"height":1083,"image_id":"sc5ppm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5ppm.jpg","width":2667,"checksum":"bae28825-a184-8806-e7a9-adcbbeb21f37"},{"id":266603,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":107196,"height":759,"image_id":"sc5ppn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5ppn.jpg","width":1867,"checksum":"4312dc2a-3ded-4f30-7793-c54af4b1d65c"},{"id":266604,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":107196,"height":650,"image_id":"sc5ppo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5ppo.jpg","width":1600,"checksum":"e2d79338-22f2-4242-c57d-aab0dbb08844"}],"slug":"gear-dot-club-unlimited-2","summary":"The most successful racing game on the Nintendo Switch is back \n \nWith the pedal to the metal, race along more than 1800 miles of roads!

It was relocated and reincorporated on July 12, 1993. Since then Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. has grown into an international company focused on creating video game products across modern console platforms. NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus. The publisher has become a somewhat of a well-known presence in the North American market, having won RPGLand's \"Stateside Publisher of the Year Award\" in 2009.","logo":{"id":457,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":300,"image_id":"kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"04ccf3d2-0f38-8c2f-6104-b6941712aecc"},"name":"NIS America","slug":"nis-america"}},{"id":82921,"company":{"id":2888,"name":"Psikyo","slug":"psikyo"}},{"id":82922,"company":{"id":13178,"name":"City Connection","slug":"city-connection"}}],"name":"Psikyo Shooting Stars Alpha","platforms":[130],"release_dates":[{"id":174174,"category":0,"created_at":1565654400,"date":1564012800,"game":121651,"human":"Jul 25, 2019","m":7,"platform":130,"region":5,"updated_at":1565654400,"y":2019,"checksum":"7e961854-08c2-55d2-4e0e-9db5d34d200d"},{"id":196634,"category":0,"created_at":1590019200,"date":1579564800,"game":121651,"human":"Jan 21, 2020","m":1,"platform":130,"region":2,"updated_at":1590019200,"y":2020,"checksum":"09b9d48d-8550-aa41-662f-79585a723be0"},{"id":196635,"category":0,"created_at":1590019200,"date":1579824000,"game":121651,"human":"Jan 24, 2020","m":1,"platform":130,"region":1,"updated_at":1590019200,"y":2020,"checksum":"5ea0e6f8-6a56-a1e9-6954-adc6dc9b8e10"}],"screenshots":[{"id":351963,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":121651,"height":416,"image_id":"sc7jkr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7jkr.jpg","width":291,"checksum":"82d04fee-91f1-fc32-c794-a9a2fd7d6d5f"}],"slug":"psikyo-shooting-stars-alpha","summary":"STRIKERS 1945, STRIKERS 1945 II, STRIKERS 1945 III, SOL DIVIDE, Dragon Blaze, and ZERO GUNNER 2 combine forces in one arcade collection!

NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus. The publisher has become a somewhat of a well-known presence in the North American market, having won RPGLand's \"Stateside Publisher of the Year Award\" in 2009.","logo":{"id":457,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":300,"image_id":"kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"04ccf3d2-0f38-8c2f-6104-b6941712aecc"},"name":"NIS America","slug":"nis-america"}},{"id":93662,"company":{"id":14942,"description":"MadGearGames is a small, independent game development team based in Spain.

To win, flip the most panels to your color in local battles, online*, or single-player. The more you flip, the faster you’ll move in a mad dash to nab power ups. Increase your flip range, turn invincible, and more across 3 modes and 12 arenas! \n \nCompete alone or against up to 3 players to see who’s best at each mode: flip the most panels before time runs up in Panel Battle, knock out the most opponents in Time Battle, or outlast your rivals in Life Battle. All 12 arenas have 4 layouts to choose from, some containing hazards like panel-flipping buttons, beam cannons, and waves so beautiful they truly stun competitors. Learn the art of the flip with tutorials and try your hand at achievements. When you’re ready to compete, jump into an online* battle or a private room with friends via local wireless.

It was relocated and reincorporated on July 12, 1993. Since then Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. has grown into an international company focused on creating video game products across modern console platforms. NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

Screencheat: Unplugged features a myriad of improvements over the original release, as well as alterations tailored just for the Nintendo Switch™, including: a graphical overhaul with more vibrant and clear visuals designed with the portable screen in mind, new and remixed maps, remastered weapons, an updated UI, full support for single Joy-Con™, dual Joy-Con™, and Nintendo Switch Pro Controller inputs, and an entirely new soundtrack introducing a fresh and mischievous medley of energetic tracks to enjoy. Remember when looking at your friends’ screen in Goldeneye was frowned upon? Well those days are gone and in Screencheat, we encourage it! Screencheat is a chaotic split-screen multiplayer shooter that forces players to rethink the way they approach conventional multiplayer games. In the Screencheat arena, fast reaction times aren’t enough to keep you alive. When everyone is invisible, players will have to master the art of taking a not-so sneaky look at their opponent’s screens and working out where they are based on uniquely coloured areas of the map and distinctive landmarks. Screencheat pays homage to iconic competitive first-person shooters such as Goldeneye, Perfect Dark and Halo, by blending the elements everyone loves about those games and shaking it up with its own unique take on the genre.

Members of the team are known to be predominately female, but the structure has changed over the years to include male developers. The team's name is meant to highlight the female members since rubies are considered the \"queen of gems\" and represent passionate love. \n \nRuby Party also partakes or supervises the various media made based on their products such as the drama CDs, light novels, magazine publications, radio programs, live events, talk shows, comics, and anime. Select animated and comic adaptations have been localized overseas, but the games have largely remained in Japan —aside from a few rare exceptions. If enough interest arises for their games, there may be a chance someday they will be brought overseas and translated into English. \n \nAs of April 1, 2016, Ruby Party doubles as a brand name for the company's romantic simulations, merchandise, licenses for multimedia projects, and stage event management.

The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called \"boxes\", \"blocks\", or \"regions\") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. \n \nJigsaw Sudoku: \n \nThe rules of Jigsaw Sudoku are similar to standard Sudoku since you must place each of the numbers 1 to 9 (or 1 to whatever the size of the puzzle is) into each of the rows and columns. However, whereas standard Sudoku also has rectangular boxes that must each contain every number, in Jigsaw Sudoku these boxes are replaced by different bold-lined shapes that must each contain every number instead. © \n \nKiller Sudoku: \n \nKiller Sudoku puzzles include all the rules of regular Sudoku but add in dashed-line 'cages' which must sum to given values. Killer Sudoku is also sometimes known as Sumdoku, Mathdoku or Addoku. The name 'Killer' Sudoku arises because of the wicked twist on the standard Sudoku puzzle, since you must not only place each of the numbers 1 to 9 (or 1 to the size of the puzzle) into each of the rows, columns, and bold-lined 3x3 (or other sizes) boxes but you must also place the numbers into each dashed-line cage so that they add up to its given total - and without repeating a digit in a dashed-line cage.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sudoku-universe--1"},{"id":28466,"cover":{"id":23445,"game":28466,"height":338,"image_id":"pvamzwgwuzct0xadcae9","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pvamzwgwuzct0xadcae9.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"39a9600c-9df3-70d2-63eb-a4c9529aa29c"},"first_release_date":1488499200,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":46558,"company":{"id":1218,"description":"Arc System Works is a video game developer and publisher originating in Yokohama, Japan and was founded by Minoru Kidooka in 1988.

The company has worked directly with companies like Nintendo, Microsoft, or Sony.\nLayers of Fear (2016) was the first game from Bloober Team’s new horror portfolio, sealing the new vision of Bloober Team for the years to come.","logo":{"id":928,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":1024,"image_id":"t25hisyg817hn2mpoply","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t25hisyg817hn2mpoply.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"59bb18d8-f2fb-fe10-af88-ec69954bf734"},"name":"Bloober Team","slug":"bloober-team"}}],"name":"Layers of Fear: Legacy","platforms":[130],"rating":90,"rating_count":0,"release_dates":[{"id":146939,"category":0,"created_at":1518220800,"date":1519171200,"game":68161,"human":"Feb 21, 2018","m":2,"platform":130,"region":2,"updated_at":1518220800,"y":2018,"checksum":"50e4af41-71ff-97ea-bd25-674f7ab2143a"}],"screenshots":[{"id":184375,"game":68161,"height":419,"image_id":"eau8wd8awevzpv1zwgzg","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eau8wd8awevzpv1zwgzg.jpg","width":745,"checksum":"508a19f3-459c-5252-7d44-024d0e168d75"},{"id":184376,"game":68161,"height":419,"image_id":"wwjqpvlknf0psyohould","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wwjqpvlknf0psyohould.jpg","width":745,"checksum":"8f0a3f29-6e24-7835-b427-5048fccf5ece"},{"id":184377,"game":68161,"height":419,"image_id":"ganlopd1ku6sptf7kx8s","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ganlopd1ku6sptf7kx8s.jpg","width":745,"checksum":"759f962a-bc2d-ef80-4534-f28446a1ac91"},{"id":184378,"game":68161,"height":419,"image_id":"p4bttcgqxhdb9csfu4rb","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p4bttcgqxhdb9csfu4rb.jpg","width":745,"checksum":"a39d6837-2190-16b7-84b9-97717c8e0981"},{"id":184379,"game":68161,"height":419,"image_id":"mc02fcyds4d1ktjesyqn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mc02fcyds4d1ktjesyqn.jpg","width":745,"checksum":"50869321-3d1d-74de-88c7-bbdba0e142ab"},{"id":184380,"game":68161,"height":419,"image_id":"yriesmw4a8ev0jzbth9k","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yriesmw4a8ev0jzbth9k.jpg","width":745,"checksum":"43810a5b-e511-5a1f-169b-ed58e8642d8f"},{"id":184649,"game":68161,"height":1080,"image_id":"l340tmbkazauu04r6rvw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/l340tmbkazauu04r6rvw.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"50e3f45d-7efe-0150-8a59-6de6c98d3cd4"},{"id":184650,"game":68161,"height":1080,"image_id":"i0zwyyljnsadskolkwh2","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i0zwyyljnsadskolkwh2.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"c0309ad9-ac08-f919-1f1d-95571110374b"},{"id":184651,"game":68161,"height":1080,"image_id":"bpgrb5dm533pvbohfohj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bpgrb5dm533pvbohfohj.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"fde7b4b5-3677-d215-5cc7-57da99d3e801"},{"id":184652,"game":68161,"height":1080,"image_id":"wk3nrbq10r3hkxnzlwmr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wk3nrbq10r3hkxnzlwmr.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"a344c9d2-64c5-5193-ab3b-241987e810ce"},{"id":184653,"game":68161,"height":1080,"image_id":"b2yby4kboqrthngmew2h","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b2yby4kboqrthngmew2h.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"81522c50-1b46-49fb-f691-dfd463407fa4"},{"id":184654,"game":68161,"height":1080,"image_id":"eyayowbt7b9xbolgruvq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eyayowbt7b9xbolgruvq.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"dc638da1-a953-ca6c-1cfd-18a87b646b15"}],"slug":"layers-of-fear-legacy","summary":"The Masterpiece of Fear","total_rating":88,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/layers-of-fear-legacy"},{"id":116575,"cover":{"id":74410,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":116575,"height":1015,"image_id":"co1ley","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ley.jpg","width":614,"checksum":"e9f948e6-b50a-c9eb-290d-5d09c217496e"},"first_release_date":1561593600,"involved_companies":[{"id":81052,"company":{"id":20873,"name":"Pawapuro Production","slug":"pawapuro-production"}},{"id":81053,"company":{"id":20874,"name":"Joymoa","slug":"joymoa"}},{"id":81237,"company":{"id":129,"description":"Konami Holdings Corporation, commonly referred to as Konami, is a Japanese entertainment and gaming conglomerate.
