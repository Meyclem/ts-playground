If they (or one of their shots) hits the player ship, one of the three lives is lost. Additional lives are earned after 7000 points are earned or after a set amount of levels is passed.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/galactic-chase"},{"id":55208,"cover":{"id":29659,"game":55208,"height":1033,"image_id":"ftfmjgoaenrd5oldun6k","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ftfmjgoaenrd5oldun6k.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"f00025ca-d69b-6d1c-4057-5ba57d4068a4"},"first_release_date":567907200,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":53817,"company":{"id":11701,"name":"Tynesoft Computer Software","slug":"tynesoft-computer-software"}}],"name":"Mirax Force","platforms":[65],"release_dates":[{"id":110954,"category":2,"created_at":1504051200,"date":567907200,"game":55208,"human":"1987","m":12,"platform":65,"region":1,"updated_at":1504137600,"y":1987,"checksum":"60f4425e-b60b-d44b-f867-3990bee00813"}],"slug":"mirax-force","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mirax-force"},{"id":24913,"cover":{"id":18023,"game":24913,"height":1367,"image_id":"dpejkqhnxrevbcleoy88","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dpejkqhnxrevbcleoy88.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"1881c55e-814c-5771-3ce6-d20f0f9f3647"},"first_release_date":410140800,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":40628,"company":{"id":1352,"name":"The Avalon Hill Game Company","slug":"the-avalon-hill-game-company"}},{"id":40629,"company":{"id":11264,"name":"Crystalware","slug":"crystalware"}}],"name":"Vorrak","platforms":[65],"release_dates":[{"id":58799,"category":2,"created_at":1476230400,"date":410140800,"game":24913,"human":"1982","m":12,"platform":65,"region":2,"updated_at":1476230400,"y":1982,"checksum":"be96201b-cc08-50b3-05cb-949bbca3f207"}],"slug":"vorrak","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/vorrak"},{"id":23944,"cover":{"id":17325,"game":23944,"height":1617,"image_id":"wpkiji9qe9lmx48oicbv","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wpkiji9qe9lmx48oicbv.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"197f2099-305c-f2d1-feb1-bff3ad9902f8"},"first_release_date":441676800,"genres":[{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":39471,"company":{"id":10800,"name":"Thorn EMI Video Ltd.","slug":"thorn-emi-video-ltd"}}],"name":"Orc Attack","platforms":[65],"release_dates":[{"id":56727,"category":2,"created_at":1473811200,"date":441676800,"game":23944,"human":"1983","m":12,"platform":65,"region":2,"updated_at":1473811200,"y":1983,"checksum":"0cbc6d2f-741e-9c68-33a8-32de989fe152"}],"slug":"orc-attack","summary":"The humans came in their thousands.

The element moves in the indicated direction until it is stopped by another element or the edge of the board.

Gold bars wild randomly spawn on the screen. It is your task to collect the bars and bring them to the assay office. The assay office in turn converts gold bars into money which you have to deposit in your bank. Each player has his own bank in town, so it's a matter of who will get the money to his bank first. After having collected ten bundles of dough you earn a house and heaps of bonus points. You can shoot the other cowboy who wil be hospitalized for a few seconds, giving you the opportunity to collect some gold/money in the meantime. The two cowboys are also followed by snakes and tumbleweeds respectively. However, snakes only go after one of the two cowboys while the tumbleweeds follow the other one. After being touched by the snakes/tumbledweeds the cowboy will be paralyzed for a few seconds. Shooting a snake turns it into a tumbleweed (and vice versa) therefore enabling the player to raise the number of enemies for his opponent.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/claim-jumper"},{"id":116158,"collection":{"id":5591,"created_at":1552521600,"games":[116158],"name":"Firefox Boulder

You control the more powerful SS Commodore, and must boat through these hazardous waters and rescue as many of these as possible. This involves travelling up a succession of screens, each of which has one person to rescue, while avoiding static rocks and debris. The screen layouts each time are random, so it is not always possible or safe to rescue the boater. You start a screen in the horizontal position you exited the previous one, so a central exit maximises your chances on the next screen. Other boats travel horizontally across the screen - contact with these results in losing a life. A tap of the fire button gives you a quick boost of speed, useful for avoiding hazards.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/barge"},{"id":24060,"first_release_date":473299200,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":39705,"company":{"id":9466,"name":"Synapse Software Corporation","slug":"synapse-software-corporation"}}],"name":"Air Support","platforms":[65],"release_dates":[{"id":57165,"category":2,"created_at":1474416000,"date":473299200,"game":24060,"human":"1984","m":12,"platform":65,"region":2,"updated_at":1474416000,"y":1984,"checksum":"7ecb906a-6aae-5bd5-73b5-c85edad5c207"}],"slug":"air-support--1","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/air-support--1"},{"id":21556,"first_release_date":420595200,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":37869,"company":{"id":10439,"name":"A.N.A.L.O.G.
