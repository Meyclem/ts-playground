After experiencing level 5 turbulence I became unconscious. Upon awaking, I found myself in a time and place unknown to me; the craft having been completely destroyed. \n \nThe place I am in is inhabited by giant bug-like creatures. Through thought waves, the inhabitants explained that they are part of a culture originally insect-like but now almost entirely mechanical. As their biological body parts began to age beyond effective use they replaced them with mechanical parts. Through their will to survive they eventually crated an entire society composed of machines. \n \nDuring this gradual conversion from living matter to machinery a group of the inhabitants started programming themselves to survive even at the expense of others in the society. They became know as the Bad-Bugs. After the complete metamorphosis to computer controlled minds these bugs began attacking the good creatures. \n \nBecause of my human reasoning and ability as an experienced test pilot the good bugs have asked for my help. I have been put in command of the best machine-bug on their planet. My task of saving the good bugs should prove extremely difficult since the Bad-Bugs have creature-machines programmed solely for the purpose of stopping me. I will, however, be awarded valuable treasures by the good bugs for every enemy I eliminate.  \n \nTo further complicate my task the good bugs have asked me to rescue the last remaining living creature on their planet, the Pixie. They have warned me to be very cautious when approaching the Pixy since it is constantly guarded by a killer, machine-bee.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/fire-fly"},{"id":40729,"first_release_date":1115251200,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"name":"Euchre","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":91573,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":1115251200,"game":40729,"human":"May 05, 2005","m":5,"platform":59,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":2005,"checksum":"e907ab8a-16ea-1d2b-1dee-bda48e79ca81"}],"slug":"euchre","summary":"Euchre is an adaptation of the card game of the same name that is popular in the midwestern and northeast United States.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/euchre"},{"id":40755,"first_release_date":389059200,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"name":"Rubik's Cube 3-D","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":91578,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":389059200,"game":40755,"human":"May 01, 1982","m":5,"platform":59,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1982,"checksum":"edf71a26-2702-9f83-d093-1dd9314e19f7"}],"slug":"rubiks-cube-3-d","summary":"Can you solve it? \n \nAre you up to the challenge of trying to master the Cube?

The first 12 of these were variations on the Blockade theme. Like its predecessor Blockade and successor Snake, the object of Surround was to maneuver a sprite across the screen, leaving a trail behind. A player wins by forcing the other player to crash into one of the trails. Various options allowed for speed-up, diagonal movement, wrap-around and \"erase\" (the choice to not draw at a given moment); in addition, the sprites could be set to operate at a beginning \"slow\" speed, or progressively speed up through five speeds.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/surround"},{"id":24486,"cover":{"id":17698,"game":24486,"height":320,"image_id":"c88izomzldylpso2lbxr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c88izomzldylpso2lbxr.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"2f7428e4-08e3-c9e2-d48f-514b8714684a"},"first_release_date":255139200,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"},{"id":30,"created_at":1320192000,"name":"Pinball","slug":"pinball","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/pinball","checksum":"b5657d72-ee36-0851-58df-e8d2413283f8"}],"name":"golf","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":93718,"category":0,"created_at":1500163200,"date":255139200,"game":24486,"human":"Feb 01, 1978","m":2,"platform":59,"region":8,"updated_at":1500163200,"y":1978,"checksum":"46505c28-a30e-c6c5-caae-73b6e20c9da0"}],"slug":"golf--3","summary":"play golf in difrent levels","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/golf--3"},{"id":40701,"first_release_date":386467200,"name":"Philly Flasher","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":91537,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":386467200,"game":40701,"human":"Apr 01, 1982","m":4,"platform":59,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1982,"checksum":"068f4dc6-bde6-368b-069f-c69d16fe5f3c"}],"slug":"philly-flasher","summary":"Philly Flasher a game in which the player controls two male prisoners with their genitals exposed catching lactation from an old witch's breast.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/philly-flasher"},{"id":46882,"cover":{"id":51498,"game":46882,"height":278,"image_id":"ziimf9u9kfewdpwno41p","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ziimf9u9kfewdpwno41p.jpg","width":200,"checksum":"156c8a5b-05a9-3509-0eb8-8b9a635f02de"},"first_release_date":486432000,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Championship Soccer","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":93722,"category":0,"created_at":1500163200,"date":486432000,"game":46882,"human":"Jun 01, 1985","m":6,"platform":59,"region":8,"updated_at":1500249600,"y":1985,"checksum":"1472abd1-45bc-a1aa-4e7c-4018f85e8048"}],"slug":"championship-soccer","summary":"Okay, soccer fans, the ATARI CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER ™ Team challenges you to a game.

Fortunately, the goal posts are never damaged, but sometimes you can score a goal on him before his ears stop ringing. \n \nNICK DANGER, the frantic forward, is mean and nasty and just loves to blast the ball into your goal shouting, \"eat leather, chump.\" Don’t let his bad manners bother you, it’s just his way of rattling the opposition. \n \n\"LUMPY\" DURAN, the left back, is without a doubt the clumsiest player in the world of soccer. Penalized twice for stepping on the ball instead of kicking it, he was finally thrown out of one game for toe-kicking the referee! \n \nALEXIE PUTSNOWSKI (Putsy), the right back.

The game was inspired by a mini-game in the Playstation title \"Brave Fencer Musashi\". \nGameplay is simple. The initial screen says \"Pressure Gauge\"; from here, you can hit select to see the first homebrew attempt at a scrolling text demo (which would later be reformulated and released as StickyNotes), or you can hit the reset button to start the game. A little song will play, and you're on your way! The interface is as simple as can be-- it only uses the button. Push the button precisely when the leftmost \"filling gauge\" is lined up with the \"range\" on the left of it. Get within range, and you'll be rewarded-- slightly. The second gauge will fill up, just a little bit. You need to have a certain amount of successes in order to fill the second gauge all the way to the top, to advance to the next level. A miss results in the second gauge decreasing slightly, so you need quick skills to fill up the second gauge completely in order to advance to the next level.

Teams have two on-screen characters, a shorter \"outside\" man and a taller \"inside\" man.

In two-player games, each player may control one of the two teams as in a one-player game, or both players may play on the same team against a computer-controlled opponent. At the start of each possession, both offense and defense select from a number of plays (such as the \"pick and roll\" on offense), then attempt to score or regain possession of the ball by intercepting or stealing it from the offense. The game offers a number of player-selectable options. Games can be set to last a certain amount of time or until one team scores a certain number of points. Three-point shots can be turned on or off, as can a ten-second shot clock. Players may also choose to include foul detection and/or a three-second lane violation.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/double-dunk"},{"id":18763,"collection":{"id":3732,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[4065,18763,41689,49334,49397,77492],"name":"King Kong","slug":"king-kong","updated_at":1507766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/king-kong","checksum":"a5cd2d90-5dda-12f9-3765-b6572b4225b5"},"cover":{"id":15094,"game":18763,"height":1371,"image_id":"du5bhh1ecpvzpvobwpfi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/du5bhh1ecpvzpvobwpfi.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"a420525b-3641-5624-9925-62cc4db566be"},"first_release_date":410140800,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":34677,"company":{"id":9451,"name":"Tigervision","slug":"tigervision"}}],"name":"King Kong","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":49754,"category":2,"created_at":1460592000,"date":410140800,"game":18763,"human":"1982","m":12,"platform":59,"region":2,"updated_at":1460592000,"y":1982,"checksum":"fbb4ff26-9151-66fc-16c8-2491f8072cbc"}],"slug":"king-kong","summary":"Rescue the lady from King Kong's clutches atop the Empire State Building.

Fries decided to create a version of Halo for the Atari 2600 after being inspired by a book called Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System by Ian Bogost and Nick Montfort. The Atari 2600 had such limited RAM, only 128 bytes, that drawing Master Chief was difficult, and creating a game with other characters was even more so.

Each succeeding wave of enemy bases moves faster and targets the player's saucers more quickly, while the force field becomes stronger and decreases the amount of space in which the saucer can move. Players score points for each base destroyed, with points multiplying each wave up to a maximum of 90 points per base. Players earn extra flying saucers with each 1000 points scored and may keep a maximum of six extra saucers in reserve.

Dueling tanks was a theme familiar to owners of the Atari 2600 since Combat, the game packaged with nearly every Atari 2600 system, had a very similar premise. However, Armor Ambush expands upon the simple battles available to players of Combat. The field of battle occupies a region greater than the size of the screen. Additionally, players can drop mines on the battlefield by simultaneously pressing the fire button and pulling down on the joystick.

It was discovered in 2000 and improved upon a little before being released to the public in ROM format. Kabobbers are strange (but cute) little creatures who just love wreaking havoc. Your objective is to send in your Buvskies to krush the Kabobbers before they krush you. You can have up to nine Buvskies onscreen at one time, but you have reserves waiting offscreen should one get krushed. You move your Bruvskies across the grid, jumping on enemy Kabobbers in order to defeat them and earn additional reserve Bruvskies. The baby Bruvskies become big ones when they defeat an enemy. The enemies get tougher and tougher, meaning very good timing is required in the later stages. Above all, you must reach Princess Buvsky before she reaches the rainbow energy at the other end of the level and devours it. A very unique game, but also somewhat fun.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kabobber"},{"id":40641,"cover":{"id":51818,"game":40641,"height":830,"image_id":"hd615vl8hwgvmnhqzmyn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hd615vl8hwgvmnhqzmyn.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"2ba5934b-6e10-f844-d784-5e035aa73b9f"},"first_release_date":412905600,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"name":"Exocet","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":91507,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":412905600,"game":40641,"human":"Feb 01, 1983","m":2,"platform":59,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1983,"checksum":"de5d6872-867a-028b-3f54-01f3c4e1c058"}],"slug":"exocet","summary":"In Exocet, you first pilot a spacecraft over the surface, shooting the defense towers in your path.

When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Pac-Man is awarded a single bonus life at 10,000 points by default. \n \nNear the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses. In later stages, the enemies go straight to flashing, bypassing blue, which means that they can only be eaten for a short amount of time, although they still reverse direction when a power pellet is eaten; in even later stages, the ghosts do not become edible (i.e., they do not change color and still make Pacman lose a life on contact), but they still reverse direction.","total_rating":79.7228289177749,"total_rating_count":18,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pac-man--1"},{"id":46881,"cover":{"id":40810,"game":46881,"height":220,"image_id":"kkepodojpfhqu260swpq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kkepodojpfhqu260swpq.jpg","width":185,"checksum":"06d3ec01-ae5f-7199-b083-f59fad38c188"},"first_release_date":412905600,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"name":"Galactic","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":93719,"category":0,"created_at":1500163200,"date":412905600,"game":46881,"human":"Feb 01, 1983","m":2,"platform":59,"region":8,"updated_at":1500249600,"y":1983,"checksum":"37ee306c-56c4-6ac5-125e-33024aa0f020"}],"slug":"galactic","summary":"Similar to Pheonix or Galaxian.

And no, Coca-Cola does not have any copies left.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pepsi-invaders"},{"id":40686,"first_release_date":428803200,"name":"Farmyard Fun","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":91527,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":428803200,"game":40686,"human":"Aug 04, 1983","m":8,"platform":59,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1983,"checksum":"c5b50c6a-8fa5-6303-b79e-93d9af50e632"}],"slug":"farmyard-fun","summary":"Farmyard Fun is an Action game, published by Suntek, which was released in Europe in 1983.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/farmyard-fun"},{"id":40695,"collection":{"id":2986,"created_at":1506556800,"games":[360,2361,2473,2926,3006,3166,3613,3782,3883,3884,3885,3886,3887,4066,4234,4406,4666,4806,5218,5254,5261,6200,6434,6589,6756,8067,8127,8130,8144,8149,8150,8151,8152,8163,8446,8447,8452,9056,10610,10662,10791,12052,12122,12826,12910,13379,17172,17753,17765,17829,18102,18142,19004,19212,19218,19761,19900,20390,20542,20627,21086,22325,22468,23586,24979,25911,27791,30977,36227,36312,40638,40695,43375,43499,43724,43737,43895,44013,44025,44839,44877,45043,45228,45564,45575,46210,46233,46431,46434,46446,46673,47392,47728,47753,47789,47790,47859,47868,48992,49153,49186,49190,49202,49275,49278,49282,49304,49339,49376,49404,49405,49406,49407,49409,49410,49478,49494,49841,49919,49942,50008,50016,50307,50372,50426,50478,51281,51370,53943,56042,57214,57622,57919,57920,57923,58005,58639,58644,58849,59938,59939,60193,60243,60832,61672,61680,61822,61960,62187,62415,63051,63272,63748,64080,65125,65155,65583,66737,67757,68735,68939,69051,69056,69231,69885,70222,70247,70250,70964,71089,71876,71987,72123,72135,72885,73439,73453,73552,73651,76602,77330,78004,78216,78286,78481,78482,78484,78590,78697,78718,79059,79552,79786,79840,79914,79954,80295,80666,81487,83509,83783,85089,85959,86045,89817,91476,97983,98009,98240,98278,98569,108251,109480,111548,113889,120809,122082,122508,122534,123397,123599,124644,127641,132153],"name":"Disney","slug":"disney","updated_at":1506556800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/disney","checksum":"df672d2f-6926-5223-d03e-11a37c1290e1"},"cover":{"id":52996,"game":40695,"height":821,"image_id":"rnmptih2cewiswodfdzm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rnmptih2cewiswodfdzm.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"0b2d26a1-4168-ad49-1842-55da56c7d02c"},"first_release_date":447465600,"name":"Sorcerer's Apprentice","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":91542,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":447465600,"game":40695,"human":"Mar 07, 1984","m":3,"platform":59,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1984,"checksum":"2ee1775a-d287-7279-90e9-4de8efa3cee6"}],"slug":"sorcerers-apprentice","summary":"Help!

The ZIG, being a much larger ship than most scrolling shooter ships, can sustain several hits before being destroyed, and has both a straight ahead shot and a rotating turret that can fire in 8 directions. SYD ships can be picked up in levels and will fly near the ZIG in four different formations. They can block enemy shots but will be destroyed if hit by enemy ships. Energy can be picked up as well, which will either restore lost health or, at full health, power up the attack of the ZIG and SYDs. \n \nThe arcade version uses a rotary joystick to control the turret, but the PlayStation port places the turret controls on the shoulder buttons.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bermuda-triangle"},{"id":18417,"collection":{"id":4883,"created_at":1512864000,"games":[18416,18417,18418,18420,40574,40700],"name":"RealSports","slug":"realsports","updated_at":1512864000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/realsports","checksum":"bc9764b3-b9eb-99d6-bed3-0ce7ffcbaf59"},"cover":{"id":14704,"game":18417,"height":469,"image_id":"vknv3gohmu5txhkbtnvt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vknv3gohmu5txhkbtnvt.jpg","width":341,"checksum":"e17ab987-3d1c-fa67-2d2b-7c254e448921"},"first_release_date":567907200,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":33919,"company":{"id":2406,"logo":{"id":1214,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":480,"image_id":"lu7o2rfktctb21oxhtr4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lu7o2rfktctb21oxhtr4.jpg","width":425,"checksum":"8b6cb20d-cd4a-719c-8fbf-c62b97e97a76"},"name":"Atari, Inc.","slug":"atari-inc"}}],"name":"RealSports Boxing","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":48498,"category":2,"created_at":1458259200,"date":567907200,"game":18417,"human":"1987","m":12,"platform":59,"region":8,"updated_at":1458259200,"y":1987,"checksum":"c714837e-4e2f-82f6-5dbf-52d2cc973f41"}],"slug":"realsports-boxing","summary":"RealSports Boxing is a boxing based video game developed by Atari and released in 1987 for the Atari 2600.

You have ninety-nine seconds to destroy the number of beacons indicated by the number on the bottom right of the screen per level.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/challenge-of-nexar"},{"id":40597,"cover":{"id":47018,"game":40597,"height":1141,"image_id":"rhlhdm1mhgdr5j39sceo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rhlhdm1mhgdr5j39sceo.jpg","width":879,"checksum":"4ddc87d6-8671-93f0-ccdb-786325ee6f76"},"first_release_date":412905600,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":30,"created_at":1320192000,"name":"Pinball","slug":"pinball","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/pinball","checksum":"b5657d72-ee36-0851-58df-e8d2413283f8"}],"name":"Time Warp","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":91473,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":412905600,"game":40597,"human":"Feb 01, 1983","m":2,"platform":59,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":1983,"checksum":"cdbab1b1-0f8e-ebba-bdef-ab0f024e1bf1"}],"slug":"time-warp","summary":"This game has you placed in a spacecraft of some kind (the cover art makes it look like a futuristic passenger jetliner with weapons attached, but I don't know honestly!) flying through what looks like a cave, while taking on several enemies that attack you from the right side of the screen.

Some ships move slower than others, and one of the ships moves so fast that the only way to hit it is by tracking it by radar instead of visually.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/submarine-commander--1"},{"id":15602,"cover":{"id":41118,"game":15602,"height":481,"image_id":"jqw7me0ffbwvekn7vw2b","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jqw7me0ffbwvekn7vw2b.jpg","width":400,"checksum":"f3170545-34a8-aebf-9693-0a56b38bffed"},"first_release_date":412905600,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"name":"Asteroid Belt","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":91457,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":412905600,"game":15602,"human":"Feb 01, 1983","m":2,"platform":59,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":1983,"checksum":"f2c633a5-77e6-a038-7ed3-f1787127be23"}],"slug":"asteroid-belt","summary":"Classical Atari 2600 game!

The area of the hole is rendered in light green, all areas outside the hole are rendered in a medium blue. On the larger holes the green is rendered as a dark green hole circle with the hole near the center. There are several obstacles that can appear, including trees, sand traps, and water features. On difficulty A, balls that go out of bounds stay there and must be hit back in; on difficulty B, the balls stick to the edge of the area. Balls hit near the water can soar over it, or if they land into the water, the ball is placed back where the shot was taken. Balls hit into sand traps will stick to the sides of the traps, and it takes a more powerful swing to free the ball. The player only uses one club - the amount of time the fire button is held down determines how much power the ball will be hit with, and how far it will go. The player's golfer can be moved anywhere on the field, with his golf club always facing the ball. On the larger hole the goal is to hit the ball on to the green. Once the player reaches the green, the game will zoom in on the green. The green is rendered as a light green circle, with a black dot as the actual hole. Once the ball reaches a hole, the player moves on to the next hole.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/golf--1"},{"id":18802,"cover":{"id":15132,"game":18802,"height":1354,"image_id":"faczw3j0zaiy8cqk5igw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/faczw3j0zaiy8cqk5igw.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"aacd5b3d-55d3-60ad-3d98-e20fcf926484"},"first_release_date":410140800,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":34753,"company":{"id":6361,"name":"Data Age","slug":"data-age"}}],"name":"Bugs","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":49838,"category":2,"created_at":1460851200,"date":410140800,"game":18802,"human":"1982","m":12,"platform":59,"region":2,"updated_at":1460851200,"y":1982,"checksum":"ade33a34-8e08-cd9a-df85-a7d3900eca7c"}],"slug":"bugs","summary":"You have been sent to investigate a life form that has been detected on a long-dead planet.

The player starts off with three reserve cannons. The object is to destroy the mutants aliens and, most importantly, the Mother Creature. The mutants hatch from moving eggs at the top of the screen. Because the Mother Creature replenishes eggs when they hatch or are destroyed, it must be defeated before the player can advance to the next wave. If a mutant or a bomb thrown by a mutant comes into contact with the cannon, the cannon will be destroyed and a reserve must be called up. A new cannon is awarded on every other wave.\nThe menu allows a variety of gameplay changes; for example, the player may toggle the shield option on or off. If activated, \"shield\" mode allowed a player to press down on the joystick to become invincible for a short period (only one shield was allotted per level). Another feature was the \"time warp,\" which allowed the player to press up on the joystick to temporarily slow down the passage of time for his opponents (i.e., they move slower than usual). Additionally, the type of shot fired could be changed by activating the \"penetrating fire\" option (which enhanced the beam fired so that it could withstand hitting two mutants rather than a single one) and/or the \"guided fire\" option (which caused the beam to be moved with the joystick rather than firing in a straight line).\nThe menu also allowed for multiple players (up to four) to be entered into the game.

Each of the two games was released separately, though it's generally more common to find them in this form. This particular double-ender is the most common to feature either of these games. \nThe Double-Ender is two games in one - each end of the cartridge has a different game. These cartridges are about 2.5 inches longer than a standard cartridge, and the case is wider in the middle. There is one long label that is typically blue, with game art for both sides split diagonally down the middle. Titles are printed in red text against a yellow banner. All the titles found on the Double-Enders can also be found in standard single-ended cases. \nXonox, based in Minnesota, started developing Atari cartridges during the height of the 2600's popularity. They contributed many high quality games available for the early platforms. Xonox capitalized on the novelty and perceived value of \"double-ender\" cartridges.

If the ball touches the floor or flies out of bounds, a point is scored.

Points are scored if the ball touches the floor or the ball flies out of bounds, but in order to score you must first successfully serve. \n \nBee-Ball supports single and two player play modes.

According to the manual of the game, tapeworms live in bean patches, love to eat fruit and are preyed upon by other critters named Beeky the Bird, Spanky the Spider and Mystery Beetle. Uhhhh, right. \nOur hero here is Slinky, a tapeworm who's patrolling the local bean patch. In order for him to get to the fruit he loves, he has to slither around the screen eating up all the beans. He consumes them by touching a bean with his head (merely a yellow square), and by doing so, another bean appears somewhere else on the screen, and then you're off again. The more beans Slinky eats, the longer he grows. Which is a problem. As you steer the worm through the bean patch, you need to take great care not to coil him back over himself because, omnivore that he is, Slinky will eat himself. \n \nDon't tread too gingerly because while Slinky is hot after those beans, a beetle is moving across the bottom of the screen, outside the patch, bearing down on something you're supposed to believe is an apple (on later levels, different fruits take the apple's place.) Trust me when I say that it takes a great imagination to believe the block graphics resemble anything you'd find at a farmer's market. Anyway, if the beetle gets to the fruit before Slinky eats his bean, two more beans appear on the screen and Slinky has to eat them, too. Other predators include the Mystery Beetle, Beeky and Spanky. They bleep across the bean patch at random intervals. If they happen to touch Slinky's head, it's curtains for the worm. \n \nTaken as a whole, Tapeworm isn't too bad. It borrows elements from Atari's Surround and Rock-Ola's obscure Nibbler. But what where Tapeworm fails is in its presentation (i.e. - crap graphics) and unresponsive controls.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tape-worm"},{"id":40766,"first_release_date":423273600,"name":"Scuba Diver","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":91587,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":423273600,"game":40766,"human":"Jun 01, 1983","m":6,"platform":59,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1983,"checksum":"bdd0747a-2534-2639-1feb-0c3ee423e46b"}],"slug":"scuba-diver--1","summary":"A game where you must dive deep into the sea to retrieve hidden treasures.

An endangered dolphin is calling you! Only by learning the dolphin's sonic language can you guide her through schools of seahorses, battling a monstrous squid, to gain magic powers from and elusive seagull. Hurry! Lend an ear... \n \nYou will guide your dolphin through openings in the seahorse schools by listening to sonic tones and catching waves. Pay attention to the following: \n \nTHE SEAGULL:  \nPeriodically, a seagull will fly overhead. You'll know he's coming when the squid changes color. Have your dolphin leap up, touch the seagull and then quickly turn and chase the squid. This is the best way to gain points. Also, the game resets at the next difficulty level putting distance between your dolphin and the squid. \n \nTHE SLIP:  \nAnother great way to outsmart the squid is by giving him \"the slip\". If the squid is right on your tail, wait until he catches a good wave. Then, reverse your dolphin's direction and swim under him immediately. As long as the squid's good wave remains on the screen, he won't be able to reverse and catch you. \n \nSCORING:  \nPoints are earned in a variety of ways. Every time your dolphin touches a seagull, or a squid, you score points. The number of points depends on the color of the squid. Scoring peaks at 800 per seagull and 8000 per squid. \n \nAlso, you'll score 100 points each time your dolphin catches a good wave or each time you run the squid into a bad wave.

For example, there is Activision's Enduro: Race for Riches, Data Age's Bermuda Triangle Replica Artifact, and Parker Brothers' Super Cobra Flight Jacket. Not surprisingly, Imagic also held several contests, one of which is \"Defend Atlantis\". Unfortunately for Imagic, there were a lot of good Atlantis players. In fact, more than four individuals maxed out the score, so Imagic had to figure out a way to decide who the top four would be. They created a special contest version of Atlantis, that they called Atlantis II, that these top scorers would use for a tie-breaker. Atlantis II is basically the same as Atlantis, except that it's faster, harder, and lower scoring. Contestants were sent a letter telling them that they qualified for this shoot off. They were to recieve in the mail the Atlantis II cartridge, along with the snorkeling set and t-shirt. According to Imagic, \"We've designed this contest version of Atlantis just for you experts.

Arcade Pinball featured actual simulations of a pinball machine ball shooter, flippers, bumpers and spinners. The game also implemented a simulation of a real ball's actual physics. The game also features a unique rollover bonus with an Atari Inc. logo on the playfield; hitting the logo four times results in an extra ball. Most of the game play involves learning how to perform specific functions, such as launching the ball or activating the flippers, with the Atari 2600 joystick. Moving the joystick controller down pulls the pinball machine plunger back while pressing the joystick button shoots the ball into the playfield. The left and right flippers are activated by moving the joystick controller left or right. The ball can be nudged (as in nudging a table gently in real life) by holding down the joystick button and moving the controller in a particular direction.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/arcade-pinball"},{"id":18675,"cover":{"id":14994,"game":18675,"height":1352,"image_id":"odrspnsqzvvuu8g3fj5f","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/odrspnsqzvvuu8g3fj5f.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"9ab1d12f-8fea-734a-45bb-7d30bf765439"},"first_release_date":441676800,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":34488,"company":{"id":66,"description":"For more than 30 years, Activision has been changing the way people play.

Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons.

Several difficulty levels are available which control the game speed and whether or not stealing bases is allowed.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/major-league-baseball"},{"id":17016,"collection":{"id":2026,"created_at":1454198400,"games":[17014,17015,17016],"name":"Swordquest","slug":"swordquest","updated_at":1454198400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/swordquest","checksum":"042ce4db-c854-28dd-cc5e-25aee7e91341"},"cover":{"id":14031,"game":17016,"height":820,"image_id":"c3zmqxiafnppvhotokzu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c3zmqxiafnppvhotokzu.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"e0d71ce9-96df-9b1b-94d9-d76140bb8287"},"first_release_date":412905600,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":31576,"company":{"id":2406,"logo":{"id":1214,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":480,"image_id":"lu7o2rfktctb21oxhtr4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lu7o2rfktctb21oxhtr4.jpg","width":425,"checksum":"8b6cb20d-cd4a-719c-8fbf-c62b97e97a76"},"name":"Atari, Inc.","slug":"atari-inc"}}],"name":"Swordquest: Waterworld","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":45421,"category":1,"created_at":1454198400,"date":412905600,"game":17016,"human":"Feb 1983","m":2,"platform":59,"region":2,"updated_at":1454198400,"y":1983,"checksum":"97dcb1c3-b1d7-f0a5-e518-719f0a188b9d"}],"slug":"swordquest-waterworld","summary":"Swordquest is an unfinished series of video games produced by Atari, Inc. in the 1980s as part of a contest, consisting of three finished games and a planned but never released fourth game.

It received mixed reviews from critics. \nThe player has the view of an airstrip as seen from the cockpit of a jet fighter. In order to start the launch, it is required that the player presses the fire button. When the player pulls back on the joystick, the jet fighter becomes airborne. A feature of the game includes a horizontal tilt that happens when the jet fighter turns to the left or the right for realistic simulation. The goal is to fire at enemy aircraft. The player also has to worry about not making a quick dive after an enemy craft that would lead to a crash landing. There is also a bar that is located on the width of the screen that allows the player to keep track of the horizontal position. It is important to stay out of heavy gunfire zones because it can lead to a nosedive crash. It is possible to pull out of a nosedive, but it would be a better idea for the player to avoid flak.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/air-raiders"},{"id":8253,"collection":{"id":2111,"created_at":1459209600,"games":[2298,2299,8253,18512,18513,18517,18518,18519,18520,18521,18522,18523,18524,18525,18526,18527,55925,61384,68961,69247,69658,70169,70319,70803,71451,72537,80650,80766],"name":"Scott Adams Classic Adventures","slug":"scott-adams-classic-adventures","updated_at":1459209600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/scott-adams-classic-adventures","checksum":"cbb8b627-eb94-ce3c-e17b-10240118780f"},"cover":{"id":14628,"game":8253,"height":376,"image_id":"xz7d3ds8i4det4goahzj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xz7d3ds8i4det4goahzj.jpg","width":270,"checksum":"937d2a13-1aeb-6370-05d4-8a4554b09893"},"first_release_date":312854400,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":33813,"company":{"id":2406,"logo":{"id":1214,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":480,"image_id":"lu7o2rfktctb21oxhtr4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lu7o2rfktctb21oxhtr4.jpg","width":425,"checksum":"8b6cb20d-cd4a-719c-8fbf-c62b97e97a76"},"name":"Atari, Inc.","slug":"atari-inc"}},{"id":33814,"company":{"id":2519,"name":"Sears","slug":"sears"}}],"name":"Adventure","platforms":[59],"rating":70.5556307477391,"rating_count":15,"release_dates":[{"id":59323,"category":1,"created_at":1477094400,"date":312854400,"game":8253,"human":"Dec 1979","m":12,"platform":59,"region":2,"updated_at":1477094400,"y":1979,"checksum":"e9c2b5ad-3425-3e77-4677-6c91060549c2"}],"screenshots":[{"id":28526,"game":8253,"height":500,"image_id":"ilwcuu9hvzpjzvynwztq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ilwcuu9hvzpjzvynwztq.jpg","width":825,"checksum":"8f836e70-cd75-2fce-d209-ca38f5ff79a9"}],"slug":"adventure","summary":"Adventure is a video game for the Atari 2600 video game console, released at Christmas time in 1979.

Originally announced in 1982, it was subsequently cancelled. Developed by Atari, the game was supposed to be the sequel to the classic Atari VCS game Combat, which was bundled with the system. In 2005 it finally saw release on the Atari Flashback 2 dedicated console, and has seen two subsequent releases, the first in the 2011 Nintendo DS compilation Atari's Greatest Hits Volume II and the second in the iPhone and Android app Atari Greatest Hits, initially released in 2012. \n \nEnvironments were an arena with a river in the middle with two bridges, forests that the tanks can use for cover, and brick walls that could be shot through or used for cover. The tanks themselves moved by themselves with the player turning the tank and controlling the speed. This game had three lives that could be used — three hits and the player loses a life — while the original allowed you to get as many shots in until the time ran out. The graphics overall were improved over the original. \n \nThe game was cancelled, probably due to the video game crash of 1983, and was forgotten until 200 copies of the prototype were produced in cartridge form and sold at the Classic Gaming Expo in 2001. The prototype featured the unfinished game, which included the features listed above, but people were surprised to find a level editor inside the game. \n \nThe game was featured in Retro Gamer Issue 15 in the \"Games That Weren't\" section.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/combat-two"},{"id":40622,"cover":{"id":57229,"game":40622,"height":660,"image_id":"asizfnviqzv9nmcltqad","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/asizfnviqzv9nmcltqad.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"9376c913-2ea2-b279-d098-392579b0f0cd"},"first_release_date":391996800,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Coconuts","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":91483,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":391996800,"game":40622,"human":"Jun 04, 1982","m":6,"platform":59,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1982,"checksum":"a87dd1fe-94e3-d8e0-ead4-92752e0c794c"}],"slug":"coconuts","summary":"In CocoNuts Stanley the intrepid jungle explorer is under attack from Coco the monkey!

The joystick's button is the throttle: Depressing it accelerates, and releasing it decelerates. Pressing the joystick leftward applies the brake. The transmission audibly shifts as the player's car accelerates and decelerates. Grand Prix is a time trial, and the competing cars are obstacles rather than competition for the finish line. The player's car can easily outpace the other cars, but if it collides with one, its speed drops lower than that of the impacted car. Driving over an oil slick causes the player's car to skid slightly sideways, but does not slow it down. Once every scale mile, the player crosses a narrow bridge over blue water.

The objective of the game is to rob as many banks as possible while avoiding the police. The player controls a car called the Getaway Car. The car has a limited amount of fuel, which can be refilled by changing cities. Robbing a bank will cause a cop car to appear, as well as another bank. Up to three cars can be present in a city at a time. Cars can be destroyed by dropping dynamite out the tail pipe of the Getaway Car (however, dynamite can also destroy the Getaway Car). The player starts out with four spare cars (lives). Lives are lost by running out of fuel, being hit by dynamite, or hitting a cop car. If the player can rob nine banks in one city, an extra car is earned.\nThe left and right difficulty switches alter how hard the game is. When the left difficulty switch is set to A, the cop cars are smarter in catching the Getaway Car; when it's set to B, enemy cars move in a more set pattern. When the right difficulty switch is set to A, the banks appear in random spots; when the switch is set to B, the banks appear in preset locations.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bank-heist"},{"id":41108,"cover":{"id":26419,"game":41108,"height":2100,"image_id":"xfzit5yqhvjmgkqnxpxd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xfzit5yqhvjmgkqnxpxd.jpg","width":1530,"checksum":"ab215752-36c1-e863-05a1-faf0de2ebaa2"},"first_release_date":602294400,"name":"Secret Quest","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":91444,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":602294400,"game":41108,"human":"Feb 01, 1989","m":2,"platform":59,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":1989,"checksum":"68541194-2871-6103-3cb6-859463d77454"}],"slug":"secret-quest","summary":"It started with one station, then three, then eight. If something isn't done, the aliens will overrun Earth. It is up to you to destroy the stations by setting their self destructs. \n \nYou move from room to room, fighting any enemies you encounter. When you beat an enemy, you get an energy pod or oxygen bottle. Fighting aliens depletes you energy and/or oxygen so kill quickly. Each weapon inflicts different damage, and depletes a different amount of energy. As a rule, the stronger a weapon is, the more energy it requires. You also use oxygen at the rate of one bottle per minute while exploring. Along the way, you will sometimes find sonic keys, and energy sword, sonic blaster or particle beam. Sonic keys are needed for certain doors you encounter in later stations. \n \nOnce you set the self destruct code, a clock starts and you must make it to the teleporter before the time runs out. The game ends when you destroy all eight stations, run out of oxygen or do not get off a station before it self destructs.

Players begin with five lives and receive an extra life at 10,000 points. \n \nCaptain Link's level is a Space Invaders clone that finds Captain Link battling egg-dropping chickens. Bonus points can be scored by shooting Gonzo's spinning head as it crosses the top of the screen. Unlike Space Invaders, the alien chickens do not advance to the bottom of the screen, and the game ends either when Captain Link destroys all the chickens, or all of your lives have depleted. \n \nFirst Officer Piggy's level closely resembles Frogger, in that you must maneuver her up the screen to the Swinetrek before it crosses the screen. Hindering your progress is space spaghetti and meatballs, which fly quickly from the left and right. The meatballs can be eaten if timed right, but if the cosmic pasta hits First Officer Piggy, she tumbles back down the screen. One life will be lost if the Swinetrek is not reached in time. \n \nThe final level is Dr. Strangepork's, who pilots the Swinetrek through a treacherous canyon lined with laser-firing Gonzoids. Destroy the Gonzoids by using the Swinetrek's boomer-ray, a cannon that fires boomerang-like missiles.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pigs-in-space"},{"id":77284,"collection":{"id":47,"created_at":1300579200,"games":[281,284,569,2031,2727,2987,3032,6633,9192,36952,38025,50279,52133,67744,72945,75843,75844,75845,75846,75847,77219,77220,77284,80435,103301,103302],"name":"Wolfenstein","slug":"wolfenstein","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/wolfenstein","checksum":"0c3da19c-6fdb-ca0f-275c-3f82a5e03df7"},"cover":{"id":95222,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":77284,"height":800,"image_id":"co21h2","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co21h2.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"d2c32958-c2fb-8a1b-4092-9c88f44b6902"},"first_release_date":1149897600,"name":"Wolfenstein VCS: The Next Mission","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":191530,"category":0,"created_at":1584921600,"date":1149897600,"game":77284,"human":"Jun 10, 2006","m":6,"platform":59,"region":2,"updated_at":1584921600,"y":2006,"checksum":"72ed60ec-6db8-6e19-88ef-9f4881568915"}],"screenshots":[{"id":376243,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":77284,"height":480,"image_id":"sc82b7","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc82b7.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"254d8c8a-16b6-2fe2-61d6-179bf8af5a87"},{"id":376244,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":77284,"height":480,"image_id":"sc82b8","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc82b8.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"a2a2f501-2900-dfa9-a577-3d93cc57b33b"},{"id":376245,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":77284,"height":480,"image_id":"sc82b9","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc82b9.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"da5034ed-7f85-ea83-2784-2dc0ad846feb"}],"slug":"wolfenstein-vcs-the-next-mission","summary":"Wolfenstein VCS: The Next Mission is a updated version of the game Wolfenstein VCS, which was a modified version of the game Venture.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wolfenstein-vcs-the-next-mission"},{"id":18537,"cover":{"id":14834,"game":18537,"height":1353,"image_id":"ab735629inpzyffc3tyj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ab735629inpzyffc3tyj.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"8eda6778-408f-7a24-4dd6-12c8ab67ffa8"},"first_release_date":441676800,"genres":[{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":34208,"company":{"id":9476,"name":"CommaVid, Inc.","slug":"commavid-inc"}}],"name":"Cakewalk","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":48981,"category":2,"created_at":1459296000,"date":441676800,"game":18537,"human":"1983","m":12,"platform":59,"region":2,"updated_at":1459296000,"y":1983,"checksum":"beeaad92-2f58-c6c6-279c-232611429f15"}],"slug":"cakewalk","summary":"You are facing six conveyor belts which are transporting cakes from the left side of the screen in your direction.

Subterranea's gameplay is broken into two types of screens. The first is a side view dogfight between your ship and some hapless enemies that are trying to home in on it. Things heat up in the second (and far more common) type of screen, which consists of Defender-style action minus the humanoids. You're required to shoot a specific number of aliens, then pass through a gate to the next stage. \n \nLike Defender, aliens come in all shapes and sizes, and have varying attack patterns. Some of them shoot at you, some bounce, but all the action is a far cry faster than Defender. Once all the aliens are destroyed, you must pass through an electro gate that zaps in certain patterns--failing this forces you to repeat the current level without scoring any points. After at least three Defender style screens, it's back to the dogfight.

This latest version of the game contains many improvements over the original: \n \nAdded support for joystick controllers. Controller type is automatically detected when you press the paddle or joystick fire button to start the game. \nFixed the flicker that used to occur at the beginning of each level. \nChanged background and data bit color palette to make bits easier to distinguish. \nReduced track size from 10 to 8 bits, for a more appropriate one byte per level. \nChanged speed increase per level - only two random data bits increase in speed each level. \nModified the sound and scoring routines to account for longer gameplay and higher levels. \nChanged title screen text and added GIS and Pixels Past logos. \nAdded a PAL version of the game.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ultra-scsicide"},{"id":17240,"cover":{"id":14051,"game":17240,"height":828,"image_id":"zospcawi1nohafraoikp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zospcawi1nohafraoikp.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"29261930-a0ac-6a1f-3a05-41ce9a4caf02"},"first_release_date":631065600,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":31909,"company":{"id":2406,"logo":{"id":1214,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":480,"image_id":"lu7o2rfktctb21oxhtr4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lu7o2rfktctb21oxhtr4.jpg","width":425,"checksum":"8b6cb20d-cd4a-719c-8fbf-c62b97e97a76"},"name":"Atari, Inc.","slug":"atari-inc"}}],"name":"Radar Lock","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":45800,"category":2,"created_at":1454371200,"date":631065600,"game":17240,"human":"1989","m":12,"platform":59,"region":2,"updated_at":1454371200,"y":1989,"checksum":"49b58624-db60-9c49-ddb7-63fb985b1a54"}],"slug":"radar-lock","summary":"You're locked in fight-to-the-death air combat with the enemy!

Gameplay is presented mostly in first person cockpit view, which is achieved with surprisingly good effect given the 2600's primitive graphics capabilities. The starfighter carries laser weapons, shields, and a faster-than-light drive. The fighter also carries a limited energy supply, which is drained by firing the lasers, being hit by enemy fire, warping, or simply flying around. If the ship's energy drops to zero it is destroyed, and the game ends. Enemy fire can knock out the fighter's subsystems (such as weapons) on top of draining energy. The game \"universe\" is a square-shaped galaxy mapped into a grid of 36 sectors. Each sector can be home to some enemy ships, a starbase, both, or nothing. The player \"warps\" the fighter to a sector to engage enemy ships; once they are all destroyed, the player moves on to another. The player can also warp to a sector with a starbase, and dock with it (a rather tricky process) to replenish energy and repair damaged subsystems. Enemy ships in turn maneuver through the galaxy as they home in to destroy the starbases. The game is won when all enemy ships are destroyed, or lost if either the player's fighter or all four starbases are destroyed.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/starmaster"},{"id":24015,"cover":{"id":17412,"game":24015,"height":1386,"image_id":"hpv2ffrvpi9tpj94mfsi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hpv2ffrvpi9tpj94mfsi.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"faabc14c-02ff-907f-1eae-c9f1a594877b"},"first_release_date":441676800,"genres":[{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":39618,"company":{"id":2522,"name":"Imagic","slug":"imagic"}}],"name":"Quick Step","platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"id":57022,"category":2,"created_at":1474243200,"date":441676800,"game":24015,"human":"1983","m":12,"platform":59,"region":2,"updated_at":1474243200,"y":1983,"checksum":"357c0838-6bda-beef-1799-1e1b6c2af462"}],"slug":"quick-step","summary":"Quick Step! is a unique take on the Q*Bert formula by adding two player action and a more frantic pace. You are a kangaroo who loves to paint trampolines green. However, a squirrel likes to paint them blue. Naturally, this can result in some hectic competition between the two. Jumping on one of the trampolines will turn it the color of your character and earn you points. During the game the trampolines scroll down to the bottom of the screen before they disappear. Naturally, you must avoid being on a trampoline when it disappears, otherwise you will lose a life. \n \nOccasionally, you may find a special square that will cause your character to flash. If you jump onto a trampoline where the other character is, they will be stunned briefly, giving you an opportunity to make them lose a life. What is truly unique is how the computer player also has a limited number of lives just like the human player does. After one player loses all of their lives, the other player is awarded extra points for his or her remaining lives. If you want to get big points, you have to adopt a different strategy to avoid having your opponent lose all their lives. Truly a unique and fun experience, although the game can be frustrating to play against the computer as you'll find it easy to stay alive longer than the computer.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/quick-step"}]}
