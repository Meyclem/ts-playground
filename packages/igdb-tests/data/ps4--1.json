In the world of Valkyria Chronicles, the year is 1935 E.C., and the continent of Europa has been plunged into the Second Europan War between the Autocratic East Europan Imperial Alliance -- also known as The Empire -- and the Atlantic Federation over the precious resource Ragnite.

Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

It was relocated and reincorporated on July 12, 1993. Since then Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. has grown into an international company focused on creating video game products across modern console platforms. NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

We produced three award-winning PS2 games starring the wily raccoon thief Sly Cooper, all of which met with critical acclaim, commercial success, and file cabinets full of fan mail. Some of it written in crayon. \n \nIn 2009, we released the open-world superhero game inFAMOUS, which rapidly turned into the summer’s must-have PS3 game, with excellent reviews and solid footing at the top of the PS3 sales charts. After launching inFAMOUS 2 in 2011, we continued the inFAMOUS franchise on PlayStation 4 in 2013 with Second Son starring Delsin Rowe and standalone DLC First Light starring Abigail ‘Fetch’ Walker. \n \nSucker Punch takes the entire 2nd floor of a skyscraper in downtown Bellevue, looking across Lake Washington to downtown Seattle.

NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

It was originally scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 3 and feature PlayStation Move support, but in August 2014, the game was reintroduced as a PlayStation 4 exclusive. \n \nUntil Dawn is designed to be played multiple times, as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough. Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the \"Butterfly Effect\" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player's choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has \"hundreds of endings\". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game. \n \nThe gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls. \n \nUntil Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, choice mechanic, horror elements, music, voice acting and gameplay design. Most of the criticism the game drew was concerning the story, mostly the second half, camera angles, character movements and partially linear plot.","total_rating":80.3503152765571,"total_rating_count":398,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/until-dawn"},{"id":26057,"cover":{"id":19090,"game":26057,"height":450,"image_id":"tqxbonxui6yypvgyfrfd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tqxbonxui6yypvgyfrfd.jpg","width":450,"checksum":"1b8c7efd-2a1c-e7a5-7290-170f89d07826"},"first_release_date":1421280000,"name":"Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Japan Exoskeleton Pack","platforms":[48],"release_dates":[{"id":61408,"category":0,"created_at":1480291200,"date":1421280000,"game":26057,"human":"Jan 15, 2015","m":1,"platform":48,"region":8,"updated_at":1480291200,"y":2015,"checksum":"f3baf71a-c184-4e41-f5e1-f37f8e21b6d5"}],"slug":"call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-japan-exoskeleton-pack","summary":"Show your patriotism with the Japan exoskeleton skin and matching helmet.

NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus. The publisher has become a somewhat of a well-known presence in the North American market, having won RPGLand's \"Stateside Publisher of the Year Award\" in 2009.","logo":{"id":457,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":300,"image_id":"kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"04ccf3d2-0f38-8c2f-6104-b6941712aecc"},"name":"NIS America","slug":"nis-america"}}],"name":"The Witch and the Hundred Knight 2","platforms":[48],"release_dates":[{"id":59629,"category":0,"created_at":1477267200,"date":1487808000,"game":24909,"human":"Feb 23, 2017","m":2,"platform":48,"region":5,"updated_at":1477267200,"y":2017,"checksum":"721194a6-65eb-9f21-8e7b-e35897c2300a"},{"id":146904,"category":0,"created_at":1518220800,"date":1522108800,"game":24909,"human":"Mar 27, 2018","m":3,"platform":48,"region":2,"updated_at":1518220800,"y":2018,"checksum":"5277d122-10cb-0dff-87c9-6d8d7ad280cf"},{"id":146905,"category":0,"created_at":1518220800,"date":1522368000,"game":24909,"human":"Mar 30, 2018","m":3,"platform":48,"region":1,"updated_at":1518220800,"y":2018,"checksum":"da085b26-4cf5-febd-b875-b07188c86d5a"},{"id":146906,"category":0,"created_at":1518220800,"date":1522972800,"game":24909,"human":"Apr 06, 2018","m":4,"platform":48,"region":3,"updated_at":1518220800,"y":2018,"checksum":"6e265ae4-792e-1b16-fe3b-8040f787a03c"},{"id":146907,"category":0,"created_at":1518220800,"date":1522972800,"game":24909,"human":"Apr 06, 2018","m":4,"platform":48,"region":4,"updated_at":1518220800,"y":2018,"checksum":"2fa997f5-5215-4e8f-c76c-e296720ee632"}],"screenshots":[{"id":184297,"game":24909,"height":360,"image_id":"jp5ixw1plipzy7kgcccy","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jp5ixw1plipzy7kgcccy.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"1dc1b23c-fc4f-15a6-4179-faf2dfdaad93"},{"id":184298,"game":24909,"height":360,"image_id":"dn18dvsarmuv445suryg","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dn18dvsarmuv445suryg.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"2c0a6222-be0d-33a1-3871-bb1a7af97a5b"},{"id":184299,"game":24909,"height":360,"image_id":"b6cfmesgyuu8clwwrvyy","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b6cfmesgyuu8clwwrvyy.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"06547e44-7797-e4ee-5320-36210e930591"},{"id":184300,"game":24909,"height":360,"image_id":"xkixz03bq1rgscrxvmoo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xkixz03bq1rgscrxvmoo.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"dc988f1c-af0a-d17c-2180-b062b41062be"},{"id":184301,"game":24909,"height":360,"image_id":"wbamcdl0fe639hmzdfp7","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wbamcdl0fe639hmzdfp7.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"a8559136-e29b-6a73-eeec-3de96440c53d"}],"slug":"the-witch-and-the-hundred-knight-2","summary":"\"The Hundred Knight has a lot to overcome as it helps Amalie and Chelka in The Witch and the Hundred Knight 2.

Some of it written in crayon. \n \nIn 2009, we released the open-world superhero game inFAMOUS, which rapidly turned into the summer’s must-have PS3 game, with excellent reviews and solid footing at the top of the PS3 sales charts. After launching inFAMOUS 2 in 2011, we continued the inFAMOUS franchise on PlayStation 4 in 2013 with Second Son starring Delsin Rowe and standalone DLC First Light starring Abigail ‘Fetch’ Walker. \n \nSucker Punch takes the entire 2nd floor of a skyscraper in downtown Bellevue, looking across Lake Washington to downtown Seattle. We offer a great environment, a friendly set of co-workers, a full benefits package, competitive salaries, and the opportunity to work with one of the best teams around. We’re proud of the games we’ve built, but we’re always looking to get better.

You must move beyond your samurai traditions to forge a new way of fighting — the way of the Ghost — as you wage an unconventional war for the freedom of Japan.","total_rating":91.89172193394384,"total_rating_count":35,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima"},{"id":19572,"cover":{"id":70182,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":19572,"height":800,"image_id":"co1i5i","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1i5i.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"22cf7009-640a-015e-6524-807a0e062a1a"},"first_release_date":1476316800,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":40033,"company":{"id":4357,"description":"Also known as Sony Santa Monica","logo":{"id":937,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":320,"image_id":"uxk76nzbpwoegjpfwexc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uxk76nzbpwoegjpfwexc.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"ed23fd2f-4ca7-4f90-7cd8-da8a3bc26d4d"},"name":"SIE Santa Monica Studio","slug":"sie-santa-monica-studio"}},{"id":40034,"company":{"id":10100,"description":"Formerly: Sony Computer Entertainment\nFormerly: Sony Network Entertainment","logo":{"id":883,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":338,"image_id":"uemryr29y3fwmrhk0ak8","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uemryr29y3fwmrhk0ak8.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"7dd7225a-6fa1-dbbf-c7ea-67aa0ab9c23c"},"name":"Sony Interactive Entertainment","slug":"sony-interactive-entertainment"}}],"name":"Here They Lie","platforms":[48],"rating":52.67719316776201,"rating_count":9,"release_dates":[{"id":57681,"category":0,"created_at":1475107200,"date":1476316800,"game":19572,"human":"Oct 13, 2016","m":10,"platform":48,"region":8,"updated_at":1475107200,"y":2016,"checksum":"8c068c70-5b90-3e28-d19f-0bf5933d12ad"},{"id":103532,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1476316800,"game":19572,"human":"Oct 13, 2016","m":10,"platform":48,"region":2,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2016,"checksum":"ea350661-6185-7ea3-9c45-c108c6fc3e83"},{"id":103533,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1476316800,"game":19572,"human":"Oct 13, 2016","m":10,"platform":48,"region":1,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2016,"checksum":"190cb8c6-1b9b-2df2-4b7c-b7f4f61af20d"}],"screenshots":[{"id":115863,"game":19572,"height":1080,"image_id":"lq1am1j2amus5rycnnnj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lq1am1j2amus5rycnnnj.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"5f89fd28-4822-25f0-22f7-7dab897f8f17"},{"id":115864,"game":19572,"height":1869,"image_id":"mzd5gusm8mr1lgrjggnp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mzd5gusm8mr1lgrjggnp.jpg","width":3322,"checksum":"926e4ffb-afc2-056f-6402-233aab7d36e3"},{"id":115865,"game":19572,"height":2080,"image_id":"bsbzhnpn20iajoaknxs0","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bsbzhnpn20iajoaknxs0.jpg","width":3880,"checksum":"91b66480-bd21-254e-4a55-d5f65721a395"},{"id":115866,"game":19572,"height":2880,"image_id":"vhua4ov4cdih3m7zvu5i","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vhua4ov4cdih3m7zvu5i.jpg","width":5120,"checksum":"a8e673cf-a607-b221-a912-6804f2e22a4e"},{"id":115867,"game":19572,"height":2880,"image_id":"bgucgaemiwwhqs72rgnc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bgucgaemiwwhqs72rgnc.jpg","width":5120,"checksum":"b2fc6198-0b98-665f-1410-276e64dcadb3"}],"slug":"here-they-lie","summary":"Here They Lie transports you to a terrifying world from which you cannot escape.

Take to the skies in seven exciting campaigns with a total of 49 missions. Embark on escorting flights and patrols as well as defense, rescue and stealth missions. Fly more than 20 aircraft types from World War I and II. Test your mettle on your path from rookie to pro, picking between two difficulty levels as well as two game modes (arcade and simulation).

Since then Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. has grown into an international company focused on creating video game products across modern console platforms. NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

We offer a great environment, a friendly set of co-workers, a full benefits package, competitive salaries, and the opportunity to work with one of the best teams around.
