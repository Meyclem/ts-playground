The Spectrum was ultimately released as eight different models, ranging from the entry level model with 16 KB RAM released in 1982 to the ZX Spectrum +3 with 128 KB RAM and built in floppy disk drive in 1987; together they sold in excess of 5 million units worldwide (not counting numerous clones).\n\nThe Spectrum was among the first mainstream audience home computers in the UK, similar in significance to the Commodore 64 in the USA. The introduction of the ZX Spectrum led to a boom in companies producing software and hardware for the machine, the effects of which are still seen; some credit it as the machine which launched the UK IT industry. Licensing deals and clones followed, and earned Clive Sinclair a knighthood for \"services to British industry\".\n\nThe Commodore 64, Oric-1 and Atmos, BBC Microcomputer and later the Amstrad CPC range were rivals to the Spectrum in the UK market during the early 1980s. Over 24,000 software titles have been released since the Spectrum's launch and new titles continue to be released--over 100 in 2012. In 2014, a bluetooth keyboard modelled on the Spectrum was announced.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/platforms/zxs/version/zx-spectrum","checksum":"940b3aa3-47fc-006c-cd7b-18ccde11e884"}],"checksum":"29af4031-6212-3484-d804-efd5411fb32c","games":[{"id":45373,"first_release_date":541641600,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"name":"Intergalactic

There are thirty screens to pass through and most are filled with hazards that threaten to block your progress (such as barrels) or destroy you (aliens and explosive mines). \n \nPlayers control a robotic \"Vorton\" (resembling a dalek from Doctor Who) and one of the things that provides Highway Encounter with its unique appeal is that the bomb is constantly being pushed onwards by your extra lives - four more Vortons, who accompany you along the highway. A key strategic element to the game is for the player character to travel several screens ahead of the bomb to clear a safe path for it; normally this would be done by temporarily blocking the bomb's forward motion. However, if the bomb is left in an unsafe location, it is possible for all your extra lives to be lost without the player character being destroyed once. Once all spare lives are lost, the player character must manually push the bomb.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/alien-highway-encounter-2"},{"id":13937,"name":"Adder Attack","platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"id":39549,"category":7,"created_at":1445299200,"game":13937,"human":"TBD","platform":26,"region":8,"updated_at":1445299200,"checksum":"4484a482-b42e-5921-e5f7-423fa5b04190"}],"slug":"adder-attack","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/adder-attack"},{"id":45371,"cover":{"id":86565,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":45371,"height":1237,"image_id":"co1usl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1usl.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"71020d88-4774-16f6-67d8-c2484fb59339"},"first_release_date":473299200,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"name":"Ad Astra","platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"id":181381,"category":2,"created_at":1575936000,"date":473299200,"game":45371,"human":"1984","m":12,"platform":26,"region":1,"updated_at":1575936000,"y":1984,"checksum":"903aa24e-54e8-88bb-8c42-33797afac1fb"}],"slug":"ad-astra","summary":"Ad Astra is an early into-the-screen 3D space shoot 'em up.

On completion the quest restarted, with more monsters and an alternative toy. \n \nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuckie_Egg_2","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/chuckie-egg-2"},{"id":14021,"name":"The Custard Kid","platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"id":39633,"category":7,"created_at":1445299200,"game":14021,"human":"TBD","platform":26,"region":8,"updated_at":1445299200,"checksum":"d49a2991-3199-e6b9-f351-d397f65358e2"}],"slug":"the-custard-kid","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-custard-kid"},{"id":14089,"name":"Gateway to Hell","platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"id":39705,"category":7,"created_at":1445385600,"game":14089,"human":"TBD","platform":26,"region":8,"updated_at":1445385600,"checksum":"27afdb10-caa4-7c51-19d0-484d58c190eb"}],"slug":"gateway-to-hell","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gateway-to-hell"},{"id":60645,"cover":{"id":42808,"game":60645,"height":387,"image_id":"vyvdha4g0kpuqimzoycf","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vyvdha4g0kpuqimzoycf.jpg","width":243,"checksum":"86dc23bd-a133-ca66-e660-1f9f18e45040"},"first_release_date":473299200,"name":"Gridgate","platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"id":119045,"category":0,"created_at":1507766400,"date":473299200,"game":60645,"human":"Dec 31, 1984","m":12,"platform":26,"region":1,"updated_at":1507766400,"y":1984,"checksum":"c6e34f17-1a60-2cbb-6ae5-5e922266005c"}],"slug":"gridgate","summary":"A maze game developed by P.

nuevos mapas, personajes, items y situaciones. El personaje principal MAD tiene que ir comiéndose todos los cocos (bolitas) que aparecen en el mapeado a lo largo de 15 pantallas laberínticas distintas, intentando no ser alcanzado por los siguientes personajes: \n \nPelmazoide: Son los clásicos fantasmas de un Pac-Man, mortales al contacto. \nMaricoco: Es una mariquita que no hace daño a MAD, pero que va reponiendo los cocos que se come, complicando el juego. \nRepugnantoso: Es una criatura, como su propio nombre indica, de aspecto repugnante, que es invulnerable a MAD mosqueado y que va pisando los cocos hundiéndolos en el suelo e impidiendo comerlos. Sólo Hipodoso o un disparo de la coconave o el cocotanque pueden destruirle. \nMAD se encontrará a lo largo del juego con distintos objetos: \n \nMosqueado: Hace que MAD pueda comerse a los fantasmas y maricocos, haciéndolo invulnerable a repugnantoso. \nHipopodoso: Convierte a MAD en un hipopótamo que no podrá comer los cocos, pero podrá destruir a todos los enemigos. \nExcavófono: Dota a MAD de una excavadora para levantar los cocos hundidos por Repugnantoso. Con ella no podrá usar los demás objetos hasta que la deje en el punto donde la cogió, donde aparecerá un icono con la cara de MAD. \nCoconave: Al entrar en una pista horizontal, se convertirá en una nave espacial que puede moverse a voluntad a izquierda o derecha, y que puede disparar, pero sólo hacia arriba. \nCocotanque: Al entrar en una pista vertical por la parte superior, se convertirá en un tanque que podrá disparar hacia la izquierda o la derecha a voluntad, pero que no puede controlar el movimiento, que se producirá de arriba a abajo automáticamente hasta salir de la pista por la parte inferior. \nTrampillas: Son puertas giratorias que al pasar a través de ellas por el lado abierto, cierran el camino a posibles persecuciones de enemigos al girar y cerrarse por el lado que abandonamos, pero que si las encontramos por el lado cerrado son muros infranqueables que pueden convertirse en una trampa mortal. \nAutococos: Son unos cocos especiales marcados con una flecha que al comerlos nos obligarán a movernos en la dirección que marca la flecha. Suelen estar dispuestos formando caminos predefinidos en los que al entrar nos obliga a recorrer hasta que salgamos del rastro de autococos. Pueden ser mortales si un enemigo se cruza por el camino mientras estamos siguiéndolo.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/max-mix-game"},{"id":14087,"name":"Galakzions","platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"id":39703,"category":7,"created_at":1445385600,"game":14087,"human":"TBD","platform":26,"region":8,"updated_at":1445385600,"checksum":"3db70094-b864-2310-645b-e496dd412bbb"}],"slug":"galakzions","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/galakzions"},{"id":45340,"collection":{"id":2862,"created_at":1502409600,"games":[45340,54627],"name":"Action Force","slug":"action-force","updated_at":1502409600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/action-force","checksum":"a5d16721-30f1-a03f-e9d5-d59f26dbb7b0"},"cover":{"id":29710,"game":45340,"height":1321,"image_id":"a2nm0d1magwwtm5dgpuo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/a2nm0d1magwwtm5dgpuo.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"2ec20d8b-2891-51b7-e95b-fbe0585c7cec"},"first_release_date":573523200,"franchises":[{"id":301,"created_at":1391472000,"games":[4877,8165,8166,13672,22697,25981,45340,54627,81200],"name":"G.I.

Unfortunately for Crax, Joe foiled his evil plans. During the rescue Joe Blade single handedly eradicated his private army of underworld henchmen, and in the process leveled Bloodfinger's fortified base. After the wholesale demolition of his jungle fortress, Crax went into hiding, Under the bizarre alias of Quentin Bloodfinger he created Crax Industries as a front organization for his flourishing narcotics empire.

There is no limit on the number of crates or refugees the helicopter can carry, and the player only needs to return to Base Island after the last crate has been found and loaded. \n \nHindering progress is the cyclone itself, which can cause the helicopter to behave erratically at long range, and crash at close range. While over open water the helicopter must avoid low flying planes which traverse the screen occasionally. The player also has limited fuel - which can be replenished at helipads on several of the islands - and a time limit in which to retrieve the crates. The screen display warns the player of the cyclones proximity, any approaching planes, and also the remaining time and fuel. \n \nThe view has two aspects of North and South to switch between, which is necessary as some of the crates are hidden behind buildings or terrain. There is also a map view to help locate the cyclone and the islands. \n \nOnce completed the game loops, with no change in difficulty. \n \nPanayi’s previous game, Tornado Low Level, (and to a lesser extent Android 2,) featured similar graphics.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/cyclone"},{"id":45235,"first_release_date":633830400,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"name":"St Dragon","platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"id":99066,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":633830400,"game":45235,"human":"Feb 01, 1990","m":2,"platform":26,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":1990,"checksum":"64f7a09e-6767-faa4-f8e7-32c31335f196"}],"slug":"st-dragon","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/st-dragon"},{"id":58251,"cover":{"id":35763,"game":58251,"height":513,"image_id":"zrgkezrgu9opg714wfoi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zrgkezrgu9opg714wfoi.jpg","width":397,"checksum":"fb96a812-7b8e-4921-5b1a-74343a3da07c"},"first_release_date":536371200,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":26,"created_at":1301961600,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","slug":"quiz-trivia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/quiz-trivia","checksum":"256a99dd-dd06-bc0c-d53b-dc3098da4d49"}],"name":"Psi Chess","platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"id":123382,"category":0,"created_at":1508457600,"date":536371200,"game":58251,"human":"Dec 31, 1986","m":12,"platform":26,"region":1,"updated_at":1508457600,"y":1986,"checksum":"bc8a8c4c-1139-cff6-8af8-3e02a7340576"}],"slug":"psi-chess","summary":"A chess game written by Steven L.

The objective is to lead your party of five survivors across the devastated United States to sanctuary.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/four-minutes-to-midnight"},{"id":14001,"cover":{"id":23810,"game":14001,"height":1281,"image_id":"tsu3mjrvbes7kyqu5cvn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tsu3mjrvbes7kyqu5cvn.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"8442a7e9-1158-6891-d8f4-e8bfbf81d06e"},"first_release_date":599529600,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":54483,"company":{"id":13105,"name":"Atlantis Software Limited","slug":"atlantis-software-limited"}}],"name":"Cerius","platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"id":113625,"category":2,"created_at":1505865600,"date":599529600,"game":14001,"human":"1988","m":12,"platform":26,"region":1,"updated_at":1505865600,"y":1988,"checksum":"207546ee-5c58-1a6a-f688-1c797d62e870"}],"slug":"cerius","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/cerius"},{"id":13969,"name":"Billy Bong","platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"id":39581,"category":7,"created_at":1445299200,"game":13969,"human":"TBD","platform":26,"region":8,"updated_at":1445299200,"checksum":"d6beb292-2542-dd11-826a-0e52c1a1bcac"}],"slug":"billy-bong","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/billy-bong"},{"id":58867,"cover":{"id":38712,"game":58867,"height":240,"image_id":"cm2gbzkfzhnwl2t7vasp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cm2gbzkfzhnwl2t7vasp.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"d6972fba-96e5-3558-943a-d7c3e92fac21"},"first_release_date":631152000,"name":"A.R.C.","platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"id":174625,"category":0,"created_at":1566259200,"date":631152000,"game":58867,"human":"Jan 01, 1990","m":1,"platform":26,"region":8,"updated_at":1566259200,"y":1990,"checksum":"102fcb99-55a3-0a1c-8375-342c4f86cfc7"}],"slug":"arc","summary":"A text adventure written by Ian and Tom Smith.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/arc"},{"id":13951,"name":"Alphabet Games","platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"id":39563,"category":7,"created_at":1445299200,"game":13951,"human":"TBD","platform":26,"region":8,"updated_at":1445299200,"checksum":"b2249419-5251-717d-bcae-b5ac19e76255"}],"slug":"alphabet-games","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/alphabet-games"},{"id":14041,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Droidz","platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"id":39653,"category":7,"created_at":1445299200,"game":14041,"human":"TBD","platform":26,"region":8,"updated_at":1445299200,"checksum":"65b3faa6-87f6-9b39-b5a6-118e8e33a1ff"}],"slug":"droidz","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/droidz"},{"id":13989,"cover":{"id":67838,"game":13989,"height":484,"image_id":"oz8h6pjkqyjbtjb6u2f6","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oz8h6pjkqyjbtjb6u2f6.jpg","width":305,"checksum":"548800a9-02cf-5569-29db-3fb143c1fdef"},"first_release_date":441676800,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":40252,"company":{"id":4505,"name":"Cases Computer Simulations","slug":"cases-computer-simulations"}},{"id":68835,"company":{"id":16207,"name":"C.P.M.

game differs from its predecessor by an increase in the size of the play area (including a neighbouring girls' school) and a number of gameplay changes. \n \nThe girls' school incorporates its own new characters including undistinguished girls with hockey sticks, Hayley (girlfriend of the main character Eric) and Miss Take (the headmistress). Only at break time and lunch times are the girls allowed to mingle with the boys, in the central grassy playground, separated at other times by a high gate. The opening and closing of the gate is controlled by the school caretaker Albert, a new character to the game. It is also possible for Eric to sneak over the gate into the girls' school during lesson times, either using the bicycle (after completing the challenge of finding its lock's combination and then performing a tricky manoeuvre on it), by watering the flower beside the gate and then jumping on it, or by kissing Hayley through the gate. When the girls and boys are allowed to mingle and when Eric gains access to the girls' school, he can kiss Hayley, who will then agree to do 1000 of his lines for him. This reduction method can be used up to six times before Hayley refuses to help Eric any more. \n \nElements added in Back to Skool include stink bombs (used to trigger the opening of windows), water pistols, mice that can be released in the girls' school causing widespread panic, and sherry (which can be squirted into cups and used to \"intoxicate\" teachers by splashing it on them with correct timing).","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/back-to-skool"},{"id":13942,"collection":{"id":3638,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[13942,62610,76911],"name":"Star Cruiser","slug":"star-cruiser","updated_at":1507766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/star-cruiser","checksum":"6b4437cc-4590-b66d-6ae4-1ad298b9cfbc"},"cover":{"id":51641,"game":13942,"height":384,"image_id":"zghd6biwwgcsghjfz8hz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zghd6biwwgcsghjfz8hz.jpg","width":259,"checksum":"2e5e625e-fe6d-9117-f9e1-1962db8de34d"},"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"},{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Akbarr","platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"id":39554,"category":7,"created_at":1445299200,"game":13942,"human":"TBD","platform":26,"region":8,"updated_at":1445299200,"checksum":"e8b886ca-9a8d-d646-d273-9ed908af5313"}],"slug":"akbarr","summary":"An early role-playing shooter released by Arsys Software for the PC-88, PC-98 and FM-7 computers in 1986 and ported to MS-DOS by Brøderbund.

Worst of all are the sharks which can cut through your cord - make sure they do not swim above you close to the line.

It was one of the few Spectrum games that were also available in ROM format. It formed part of the “Horace” series, which included “Horace Goes Skiing” and “Horace and the Spiders” and the unpublished “Horace to the Rescue”. \n \nHorace is apurple blob with arms and legs, who wanders around a maze, eating everything and avoiding the park guards, who are out to capture him. He is able to momentarily scare the guards, making them vulnerable, by ringing a bell in the maze. Once Horace is able to escape capture and leave the maze, he moves to the next, more challenging level. \n \n“Hungry Horace” was programmed by William Tang, but Alfred Milgrom was responsible for the design of the inimitable Horace an artful creation of character using minimum grid available . Through Melbourne House’s relationship with Sinclair, the “Horace” games would come boxed with the ZX Spectrum, making them often the first games that many people played on their home computers.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hungry-horace"},{"id":28562,"cover":{"id":23788,"game":28562,"height":1553,"image_id":"aq1aisvjouez8silpawl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aq1aisvjouez8silpawl.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"92112fc0-c55e-14fe-a250-a45af5744a58"},"first_release_date":473299200,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":46696,"company":{"id":11742,"name":"M.A.D.","slug":"mad"}}],"name":"Delta

Each enemy motorcycle destroyed is worth $1000 (i.e. points) to the player. The player's motorcycle is equipped with forward-firing guns with which to shoot its quarry. The projectiles can be controlled mid-flight simply by steering the bike. If both enemy motorcycles are destroyed, the player moves to a night version of the same level. If both enemy motorcycles on that level are destroyed, the player moves on to a daytime level of the next stage (with more trees to avoid). There are also tanks and helicopters which appear on the horizon and can be shot for bonus points. \nThe game takes place over eight stages.

Ultimate are perhaps best remembered for the big-selling titles Jetpac and Sabre Wulf, each of which sold over 300,000 copies in 1983 and 1984 respectively, and their groundbreaking series of isometric arcade adventures utilising a technique termed Filmation. Knight Lore, the first of the Filmation games, has been retrospectively described in the press as \"seminal ... revolutionary\".\n\nBy the time of the label's last use in 1988 on a retrospective compilation, Ultimate had evolved into Rare, and moved on to developing titles for Nintendo consoles. Rare was purchased by Microsoft in 2002 for US$377 million, a record price for a video game developer, and now develops exclusively for Microsoft's Xbox One console. In 2006, Rare revived the \"Ultimate Play The Game\" name for an Xbox Live Arcade remake of Jetpac named Jetpac Refuelled.","logo":{"id":641,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":145,"image_id":"uer8wf2ungnylqzkjpwd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uer8wf2ungnylqzkjpwd.jpg","width":560,"checksum":"4a58d6a4-40e9-9054-7f1e-0ca737e81026"},"name":"Ultimate Play the Game","slug":"ultimate-play-the-game"}}],"name":"Lunar Jetman","platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"id":20709,"category":2,"created_at":1413417600,"date":441676800,"game":7852,"human":"1983","m":12,"platform":26,"region":1,"updated_at":1413417600,"y":1983,"checksum":"693b9e54-1d23-5e21-e22b-cc7b6fe2d272"}],"slug":"lunar-jetman","summary":"Lunar Jetman is a shooter video game developed and published by Ultimate Play The Game. It was released for the ZX Spectrum in 1983 and the BBC Micro in 1984.[1] The game is the second instalment of the Jetman series and one of the few games released to support the Currah Microspeech peripheral. In the game, Jetman has to destroy alien bases whilst simultaneously defending himself, along with Earth, from a hostile alien race. \n \nLunar Jetman was Ultimate Play The Game's first game to require 48K of RAM - all previous games had run on unexpanded 16K models. The game was written by Chris Stamper with graphics designed by Tim Stamper. The game was followed by a third instalment, Solar Jetman: Hunt for the Golden Warpship, released for the NES in 1990. The game was met with critical acclaim upon release, with praise mostly directed at its addictive gameplay and wide range of colours. It was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/lunar-jetman"}]}
