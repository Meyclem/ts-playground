The story begins with a man named \"Amachi\" discovering the fallen protagonist on the ground near a cliff. The protagonist discovers that he has lost his memory, and after recuperating, he revisits the cliff and meets a young girl named Ayumi Tachibana.

Characters have HP, MP (SP for fighter characters), EXP, equipment, stats and class-specific, SP-draining special elemental abilities very much like traditional console RPGs. The player can explore his surroundings, talk to people and visit shops when not in battle, though to a limited degree as there is no world map and no way to leave the current area. \n \nThe game's core is its turn-based battles fought on a 2d grid. Characters are assembled into parties of four and the player allowed a maximum of six parties, which are usually well outnumbered. The two opposing sides act in alternating turns so that each party can move once and/or attack once a turn. Attacks are divided into distant and close-up combat. In the former, a party uses a special ability (e.g. casting fireballs, throwing lightning, healing allies) of one of its members at a distance. The range and possible area of effect damage vary per ability. If the attacking party has two or more characters with the same ability, they join in the action to multiply its effectiveness. Distant combat results in less money and generally less damage, but the target cannot retaliate. Distant attacks can also affect the field; fire and ice ignite or extinguish forests and melt or freeze ice, etc. Close-up, each unit in two adjacent opposing parties can act once. Very much like Final Fantasy SNES combat, they can attack an enemy, use an item or a special ability (though these can't be combined and most only affect one target instead of all) or defend. \n \nDragons are the player's ace in the hole. They have their own stats and gain experience like normal characters do. In battle, each party has a dragon attached to it and draws a large portion of its strength from that of its dragon: if a party's dragon is slain, the party will lose the ability to use special attacks and class-specific abilities for the remainder of the map. The beast acts as a very powerful autonomous unit that moves after its party does and it cannot be controlled beyond very simple commands, e.g. \"Come!\" Out of battle, dragons will eat anything and raising them by feeding them items is an important part of the game. Feeding can improve their stats as well as affect their behavior on the field, and the dragons develop into new forms as they grow. \n \nThe player can change the characters in each of the parties, their formation as well as what dragon represents them at will.","total_rating":79.02054675777299,"total_rating_count":5,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bahamut-lagoon"},{"id":41262,"first_release_date":580262400,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"name":"Fuuun Shourin Ken: Ankoku no Maou","platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"id":91824,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":580262400,"game":41262,"human":"May 22, 1988","m":5,"platform":58,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1988,"checksum":"487e02e4-796f-8c52-6e1c-9ed73e714587"}],"slug":"fuuun-shourin-ken-ankoku-no-maou","summary":"A student must avenge the murder of his master, and fight all adversaries as they come to challenge the Shaolin from all over the world.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/fuuun-shourin-ken-ankoku-no-maou"},{"id":41368,"collection":{"id":3320,"created_at":1507334400,"games":[41368,41369,41370,41371,47251],"name":"Famimaga Disk","slug":"famimaga-disk","updated_at":1507334400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/famimaga-disk","checksum":"d0002b55-aeba-bff2-3fab-5546d377f131"},"cover":{"id":37180,"game":41368,"height":224,"image_id":"xz8tczcgqp1shh7vedtn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xz8tczcgqp1shh7vedtn.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"7755381e-a64f-3c3e-f4ef-a892d54605de"},"first_release_date":727660800,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Janken Disk Shiro","platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"id":91922,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":727660800,"game":41368,"human":"Jan 22, 1993","m":1,"platform":58,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1993,"checksum":"a4f90f85-3a1c-9d58-ecb4-368eb91b0d75"}],"slug":"janken-disk-shiro","summary":"The sixth and final game featured as the coverdisk of the Japanese Famimaga magazine. Janken Disk Shiro is a block-pushing puzzle game based on the playground game Janken (Rock, Paper, Scissors). \n \nJanken Disk Shiro, or Famimaga Disk Vol. 6 Janken Disk Shiro, is a puzzle game in which the protagonist (who looks uncannily like Disk-kun, the mascot of the Famicom Disk System) must brave a labyrinth of puzzles. In each room there are three variants of hand-shaped blocks between the hero and the exit: each one either making the \"scissors\" gesture, the \"rock\" gesture or the \"paper\" gesture. Pushing a block adjacent to another of a different type causes whichever was the inferior (e.g. with paper and rock, rock is the inferior) to vanish. In addition, each block has a \"strength\" which is signified by its color: green is level 1, yellow is level 2 and red is level 3. If a green block is pushed next to an inferior red block, the red block will instead become yellow instead of vanishing (and then green with a subsequent superior block, and then will vanish after a third). \n \nGameplay revolves around finding the right blocks to push together to clear a way to the exit. Not every block needs to be eliminated: just those that are direct obstacles between the player and the end of the stage. \n \nThe game adopts a familiar veneer of the typical 8-bit fantasy RPG: The player starts in a small town in which they can talk to NPCs and purchase power-ups, they can visit the King in his castle to begin their quest and they can visit the dungeons in which the puzzles are found (after receiving permission from the King). \n \nJanken Disk Shiro has the distinction of being the very last game ever produced for the Famicom Disk System. The peripheral had been effectively retired by the 90s due to advancements in NES cart technology.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/janken-disk-shiro"},{"id":41361,"cover":{"id":46240,"game":41361,"height":164,"image_id":"zwfav3wkmhpwp3zovlk9","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zwfav3wkmhpwp3zovlk9.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"c141003b-c7ac-a20c-d5e4-9dc1733856c4"},"first_release_date":683164800,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Time Twist: Rekishi no Katasumi de...

In this role-playing game the player controls two main pilots from the series, Noa Izumi and Isao Ota, as they complete their typical duties each day, helping to deal with rogue Labors (Mecha) and other such incidents. \n \nThe gameplay consists of three modes - a map of Japan, showing where assignments are located, the \"main\" screen, where the player controls the Labor from a top-down viewpoint and maneuvers it around the area of the crime, and the combat screen, for when you press the action button to attack a rogue Labor. From here it is possible to select one of various attacks; naturally, as the game goes on the pilots can learn new attacks. Unusually for an RPG there is also the option to just talk with the rogue Labor's pilot and try to convince them to back down - as a policeman, sometimes this is the only way forward.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kidou-keisatsu-patlabor"},{"id":42567,"collection":{"id":3072,"created_at":1507075200,"games":[37855,38161,38350,42222,42293,42567,46866,48300,49148,56519,63047,64326,64785,64799,66069],"name":"Compati

The more cities a team has, the more energy that team produces every round to direct toward the construction of newer and more powerful Gundams. Each team gets to issue three commands per turn, whether it be to move a Gundam around the map, or construct a new Gundam. Each type of robot has different ranges of movement, and different terrains effect how far a robot can travel. In order to destroy each other, players must attack the opposing team's Gundams by moving one of their own to a tile occupied by the enemy.

Each level has a different smattering of obstacles that the player must avoid, which also includes any other part of the snake itself. \n \nThough originally released on the MSX 2 home computer by Sony, it was later ported by Taito to the PC-88 and Famicom Disk System.

From the beginning you'll be locked in dog-eat-dog dogfights, battling tooth and nail past Attackon defenses, from the South Seas to the Arctic Circle. \n \nThen prepare for the ultimate challenge - the Attackon Fortress on the edge of space, where the professor is held hostage, and where Earth's survival rests on your shoulders. \n \nFeaturing simultaneous play for two players or play against the computer.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/moero-twinbee-cinnamon-hakushi-o-sukue"},{"id":41273,"cover":{"id":26512,"game":41273,"height":962,"image_id":"uib5cg8wpxybcyucqmsr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uib5cg8wpxybcyucqmsr.jpg","width":930,"checksum":"e99bfe59-82d0-7d2f-3292-d04c214583b8"},"first_release_date":629596800,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Famicom Mukashibanashi - Yuuyuuki - Zenpen","platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"id":91851,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":629596800,"game":41273,"human":"Dec 14, 1989","m":12,"platform":58,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1989,"checksum":"27c04b57-8b3f-0a74-0861-632c89549599"}],"slug":"famicom-mukashibanashi-yuuyuuki-zenpen","summary":"This is the 2nd chapter in this series. \n \nYuuyuki is an adventure game played by choosing from several text commands shown on screen. It resembles its predecessor, Shin Onigashima, in its implementation of the \"Change Character\" command, usage of traditional Japanese fairytales, and general screen layout and appearance. The story-line is a parody of the Chinese novel Journey to the West, where two main characters, Goku and Chao, embark upon separate journeys to find one another. \n \nIn Yuuyuki, the \"Change Character\" command can switch between a maximum of five different characters. However, there are very few points in the game where it can actually be used to such extent. Its main use is to switch between Goku and the others accompanying him. Like Shin Onigashima, the character in use can greatly affect the descriptive text shown on screen, and the significant increase in number of characters allowed for more variety in each scene. It is possible to enjoy the game by viewing the reactions towards choosing completely unrelated characters or commands in certain situations. \n \nWhile Shin Onigashima demanded rather complex puzzle-solving abilities, Yuuyuki mainly focuses on having the player carefully read and understand the story-line. Puzzles are solved easily in this game, and very few choices actually lead to a \"game over\" screen. Easy trivia questions and simple action gameplay emerge at certain points, and players may find themselves searching for the obvious answer on screen more often than thinking hard to solve the puzzle at hand. \n \nMain changes in gameplay from Shin Onigashima include the implementation of the \"Ittaisan\" command, which saves progress at any point during the game, and faster animation of game text. The shortening in load time after choosing commands, and an overall decrease in difficulty allowed Yuuyuki to run at a much quicker tempo than its predecessor.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/famicom-mukashibanashi-yuuyuuki-zenpen"},{"id":41267,"cover":{"id":26495,"game":41267,"height":960,"image_id":"rfugg4q2vrollueap4bo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rfugg4q2vrollueap4bo.jpg","width":926,"checksum":"1cd5e4fb-20f2-968d-9842-50ee61aedb9b"},"first_release_date":573177600,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"name":"Fire Bam","platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"id":91819,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":573177600,"game":41267,"human":"Mar 01, 1988","m":3,"platform":58,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1988,"checksum":"d8c165af-2293-3c74-a52e-608600029331"}],"slug":"fire-bam","summary":"Bam is a fifteen years old courageous boy.

Although it contained no actual real-world hockey teams, it did contain several teams based on real North American cities. For its Famicom Disk System adaptation it was called Konami (or Konamic) Ice Hockey. \n \nThere are eight playable teams that are based in real North American cities but bear no relation to their NHL counterparts. The eight teams are Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal, Los Angeles, Minnesota, Chicago, and New York. Each team has one anonymous line of 3 forwards, 2 defensemen and 1 goalie. \n \nThere are two game types: Exhibition and Tournament. In Exhibition, the player takes on either a CPU or another human-controlled team for a single match. In Tournament, the player’s team is placed into a three-round elimination tournament. Both game types can be played on three difficulty levels; Junior, College and Pro. \n \nAlthough the matches are structured the same as regular hockey games (3 periods of 20 minutes each), the speed of the clock is sped up. There are no offside or penalty calls, with one notable exception. If two players bump into each other a few times, they will start a fight. Interestingly, only the loser is sent to the penalty box. The only other enforced infraction is “Icing”. If the game is tied after the 3 periods, it moves to a shootout. The team with the most goals after 5 shots wins, and if the score is still tied, the shootout continues until there is a winner.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/konami-ice-hockey"},{"id":41317,"first_release_date":587952000,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Mr. Gold: Tooyama no Kinsan Space Chou","platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"id":91894,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":587952000,"game":41317,"human":"Aug 19, 1988","m":8,"platform":58,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":1988,"checksum":"5f017686-b5c8-7987-0242-bf10ce60460a"}],"slug":"mr-gold-tooyama-no-kinsan-space-chou","summary":"\"Gold, they called him.

A city twenty minutes in the future must be saved from a terrorist organization, and between salvation and you is a long, straight line full of goons who must be punched. Aside from receiving orders from your boss before each level, and the quick conversation with a boss or rare NPC, the story won't attempt to get in the way of beat-downs. \n \nThere are three playable characters in Ghost Chaser Densei: the martial artist Makai, the mace wielding cat-girl Iyo, and the autonomous robot Belva. Each has unique moves as well as the basic abilities of attacking, jumping, blocking, throwing, and using a special if attack and jump are pressed together. Unlike most brawlers these special moves deplete a recharging special bar, not your health. Makai can throw fireballs and do a flying kick in midair, Iyo can triangle jump and preform a spinning piledriver, and Belva can double jump and preform a grapple special. Characters also have a team up special if playing in two player mode. Enemies range from armored soldiers to lizard men to robots, but most break down into the same hierarchy: weaker types will rush at you while stronger types will shoot projectiles then rush at you. Each level ends with a unique boss with multiple short and long range attacks.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ghost-chaser-densei"},{"id":16292,"collection":{"id":2005,"created_at":1452816000,"games":[16289,16292,42212,67851,80655],"name":"Brandish","slug":"brandish","updated_at":1452816000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/brandish","checksum":"e158b593-644c-62f9-acad-39eee304c075"},"cover":{"id":13873,"game":16292,"height":899,"image_id":"nrxpaxa9cmedv1eoqt1z","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nrxpaxa9cmedv1eoqt1z.jpg","width":495,"checksum":"6d5a80d9-e41c-71ce-1235-31e5eef10b59"},"first_release_date":808099200,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":30525,"company":{"id":2400,"name":"Falcom","slug":"falcom"}},{"id":30526,"company":{"id":630,"logo":{"id":1305,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":190,"image_id":"ex1qj9juw4fssixmzi7u","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ex1qj9juw4fssixmzi7u.jpg","width":420,"checksum":"4281916b-400a-5a8c-1217-9665b4cf1b34"},"name":"Koei","slug":"koei"}}],"name":"Brandish 2","platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"id":44151,"category":0,"created_at":1452816000,"date":808099200,"game":16292,"human":"Aug 11, 1995","m":8,"platform":58,"region":5,"updated_at":1452816000,"y":1995,"checksum":"7cb2849d-d538-bb94-0546-8408cf85d56a"}],"screenshots":[{"id":19695,"game":16292,"height":194,"image_id":"hykjepcb5lkdqamjrnaz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hykjepcb5lkdqamjrnaz.jpg","width":260,"checksum":"e10e521d-5857-ef6f-4611-abccbdad8c70"}],"slug":"brandish-2","summary":"The fourth game in the Brandish series.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/brandish-2"},{"id":15906,"collection":{"id":1996,"created_at":1452556800,"games":[15906,15907],"name":"Dual Orb","slug":"dual-orb","updated_at":1452556800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/dual-orb","checksum":"36ef5834-3c80-f2ef-ff45-a6a7eb15ccf7"},"cover":{"id":13825,"game":15906,"height":183,"image_id":"phusckulwxrjqsumhpqp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/phusckulwxrjqsumhpqp.jpg","width":100,"checksum":"b77b306c-2169-b404-14df-3244d2b7a60c"},"first_release_date":734918400,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"name":"Dual Orb","platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"id":43653,"category":0,"created_at":1452556800,"date":734918400,"game":15906,"human":"Apr 16, 1993","m":4,"platform":58,"region":5,"updated_at":1452556800,"y":1993,"checksum":"532aacd0-ea15-4815-0d88-1d286a606394"}],"screenshots":[{"id":19587,"game":15906,"height":438,"image_id":"ylqzrmsowf5nfpd8snou","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ylqzrmsowf5nfpd8snou.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"aec41a7c-18ed-f858-eb28-d31b44e4108d"}],"slug":"dual-orb","summary":"In an alternate reality, in a parallel world, there are humans just like in the universe we dwell in.

However, the image (and thus the smaller pieces of the image) is constantly moving as it loops through an animation: This makes putting the puzzle together even more complicated, though it's occasionally made easier by carefully watching how pieces interact with each other. \n \nThe game was developed by Tamtex, a subsidiary of Irem that made computer games, and published by Irem in Japan. The game would be later ported to the MSX and C64 home computers, as well as on the Sega Game Gear. It was also followed a year later with a FDS-only sequel, Kineco II, which was only available via the Disk Writer service.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-monitor-puzzle-kineko-kinetic-connection"},{"id":42296,"collection":{"id":4267,"created_at":1512691200,"games":[34022,42296,65419,80733],"name":"Tenshi no Uta","slug":"tenshi-no-uta","updated_at":1512691200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/tenshi-no-uta","checksum":"48c49018-fb17-6f9b-3476-ba3353c9fa0b"},"cover":{"id":92006,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":42296,"height":900,"image_id":"co1yzq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1yzq.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"0659a93e-8ba5-304d-d887-ab3b0efdcdf9"},"first_release_date":775440000,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":87341,"company":{"id":827,"name":"Telenet Japan","slug":"telenet-japan"}}],"name":"Tenshi no Uta: Shiroki Tsubasa no Inori","platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"id":179894,"category":0,"created_at":1574035200,"date":775440000,"game":42296,"human":"Jul 29, 1994","m":7,"platform":58,"region":5,"updated_at":1574035200,"y":1994,"checksum":"9c43ab9b-aef8-e6b1-30f2-b940515c3fd8"}],"slug":"tenshi-no-uta-shiroki-tsubasa-no-inori","summary":"Tenshi No Uta: Shiroki Tsubasa no Inori (天使の詩 〜白き翼の祈り is a video game published by Nippon Telenet Japan for the Super Famicom in 1994.

The game uses a combination of hand-drawn sprites and CGI pre-rendered one (mostly for the main characters) with a distinct cute or Super Deformed design (as usual for most console RPGs).","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/treasure-hunter-g"},{"id":38225,"collection":{"id":4357,"created_at":1512691200,"games":[38225,53429,64978,69584,134435],"name":"SimCity","slug":"simcity","updated_at":1512691200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/simcity","checksum":"3d43294a-83f5-3229-7ed0-8a733ee76fe1"},"cover":{"id":108796,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":38225,"height":1128,"image_id":"co2by4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2by4.jpg","width":846,"checksum":"326b0ce2-ca6b-3095-ddcb-fba2ef126831"},"first_release_date":838339200,"franchises":[{"id":1017,"created_at":1495152000,"games":[237,330,1272,1274,1275,1491,1492,1493,1494,1497,8804,18494,20053,20106,20181,27891,28955,38225],"name":"Sim","slug":"sim","updated_at":1495152000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/sim","checksum":"f09c0cb2-4144-a40e-a766-b021e990d852"},{"id":1974,"created_at":1591228800,"games":[38225,134435],"name":"SimCity","slug":"simcity","updated_at":1591228800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/simcity","checksum":"61ddddb3-63f6-b8cf-c086-6ddb6148d5dd"}],"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":103042,"company":{"id":191,"logo":{"id":1655,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":314,"image_id":"nfefljx06cvgvuocbmuo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nfefljx06cvgvuocbmuo.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"b8140a79-2f48-449e-8778-b45eaba7d54c"},"name":"Imagineer","slug":"imagineer"}},{"id":103043,"company":{"id":284,"logo":{"id":84,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":137,"image_id":"lma0xvpg423mn2wvanmk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lma0xvpg423mn2wvanmk.jpg","width":205,"checksum":"cd76c6f9-d731-9d65-2e8b-cdddc36942c7"},"name":"Maxis","slug":"maxis"}}],"name":"SimCity Jr.","platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"id":202261,"category":0,"created_at":1593475200,"date":838339200,"game":38225,"human":"Jul 26, 1996","m":7,"platform":58,"region":5,"updated_at":1593475200,"y":1996,"checksum":"34164e2b-485a-afb1-e5d3-59a41f3155e3"}],"screenshots":[{"id":390301,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":38225,"height":360,"image_id":"sc8d5p","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8d5p.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"1aea5d75-4dda-597b-9799-46a482576095"},{"id":390302,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":38225,"height":224,"image_id":"sc8d5q","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8d5q.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"928fb963-635b-7531-1992-3af7eadc8026"},{"id":390303,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":38225,"height":672,"image_id":"sc8d5r","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8d5r.jpg","width":768,"checksum":"9cfaee77-5345-42b7-fd02-3f2b2b9358d2"}],"slug":"simcity-jr","summary":"SimTown is a 1995 video game published by Maxis, much like the best selling SimCity but on a smaller scale.
