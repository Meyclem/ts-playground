If the player loses a match then that match can be replayed until won. \n \nThe player at the start of each match gets to pick how long the match duration is out of the options of 15, 30, or 45 minutes (not in real time) before being placed on the court. When on the court the player always plays towards the right of the court. First the player tries to get the ball from a throw by a well timed button press. When the player has the ball the player has the option to move, pass the ball, and jump. When jumping the player can shoot, with the accuracy of the shot depending on the timing, or just simply pass. When defending the player can cycle through the field or just simply run into the opponent to challenge for the ball. There are a few penalties that the player can get including but not limited to Travelling (not passing after jumping), Charging (Sometimes called when the player with the ball runs into an opponent), and Pushing (Sometimes called when the player without the ball runs into an opponent) with all the penalties resulting with the other team getting the ball on the side of the court.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/basketball-nightmare"},{"id":45638,"cover":{"id":37040,"game":45638,"height":761,"image_id":"nxfylas71qesggmyyrsp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nxfylas71qesggmyyrsp.jpg","width":547,"checksum":"4a32ac94-1e87-5867-9645-2a7f9ab090a8"},"first_release_date":678326400,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":90671,"company":{"id":23629,"name":"Sis Co.","slug":"sis-co"}}],"name":"Dr. Hello","platforms":[64],"release_dates":[{"id":98775,"category":0,"created_at":1500422400,"date":678326400,"game":45638,"human":"Jul 01, 1991","m":7,"platform":64,"region":8,"updated_at":1500422400,"y":1991,"checksum":"c50bb642-6414-7dd1-803e-2db8855487b3"}],"slug":"dr-hello","summary":"Dr. Hello is an unlicensed Dr. Mario clone developed for the MSX and ported to the Sega Master System.

There is also a \"Demo\" mode if the player wants to watch Rocky and Clubber Lang fight. \n \nSince Rocky Super Action Boxing is one of the later ColecoVision titles released, it includes a pause feature for the game. \n \n \nEach boxing match consists of, according to the skill level chosen, two, five, ten, or fifteen rounds each lasting one minute each. During gameplay, the player's movement is restricted to three positions or \"lanes\" vertically, and from each player's side of the ring to the front of their opponent horizontally. \n \nThe 4 button controller allows for (independently) offensive hits to the body or head, defensive blocking for the head and body, and ducking. \n \nPoints are scored in the game by hitting the opponent's guard (1 point), or with a punch connecting with the opponent's head or body (2 points for either hit). \n \nVictory can be achieved in two ways, either by knockout, or by point count if the fight goes all the way to the end.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rocky--1"},{"id":49152,"collection":{"id":2892,"created_at":1503964800,"games":[6096,45731,49152],"name":"Penguin Land","slug":"penguin-land","updated_at":1503964800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/penguin-land","checksum":"511cebdc-89bb-26a3-04f2-90c678583cfe"},"cover":{"id":29625,"game":49152,"height":1406,"image_id":"j2xbqbl0imqf8dla4op0","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j2xbqbl0imqf8dla4op0.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"bc88c5f8-34be-d624-7701-0d252612a2ab"},"first_release_date":556243200,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":95161,"company":{"id":4981,"description":"Sega Enterprises was the corporate name of Sega of Japan from the early 1960's to July of 2000.","logo":{"id":3404,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":156,"image_id":"cl2mk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cl2mk.jpg","width":469,"checksum":"9f47e482-8d49-62ff-28ea-de15d2c6d865"},"name":"Sega Enterprises","slug":"sega-enterprises"}}],"name":"Penguin Land","platforms":[64],"release_dates":[{"id":110747,"category":0,"created_at":1503964800,"date":556243200,"game":49152,"human":"Aug 18, 1987","m":8,"platform":64,"region":5,"updated_at":1503964800,"y":1987,"checksum":"337a4d15-2289-95a3-956f-a6ea69a18ddf"}],"slug":"penguin-land","summary":"Penguin Land, known as Doki Doki Penguin Land Uchū Daibōken (どきどきペンギンランド宇宙大冒険? lit. \"Thump Thump Penguin Land: Great Outer Space Adventure\") in Japan, is a Sega Master System game and the second game in the Doki Doki Penguin Land series.

It is a side-scrolling action game that follows the events depicted in the first television series from Kenshiro's battle against Shin and his gang to his final showdown with Raoh. The game consists of side-scrolling levels where the player must reach the goal while defeating numerous enemy grunts and sub-bosses along the way, each leading to a one-on-one battle with the stage's boss. Despite featuring similar gameplay, this game is unrelated to Toei's video game version of Hokuto no Ken for the Family Computer released a few months later. The game's lead programmer was Yuji Naka, who would later be known for his work on the Sonic the Hedgehog game franchise. Despite appearing on the cover artwork, Rei does not actually appear in this game. \n \nThe original Mark III version game is included along with an enhanced remake in Sega Ages 2500 Hokuto no Ken for the PlayStation 2 in 2004. The game was later re-released for the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on February 26, 2008. An overseas version of the game was produced for the western Master System titled Black Belt, which lacked the Hokuto no Ken license of the Japanese version and featured altered graphics as a result.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hokuto-no-ken--1"},{"id":19486,"collection":{"id":706,"created_at":1391126400,"games":[2313,3789,4681,7757,8501,12242,12888,13339,14272,14452,19486,19781,23621,43869,45232,45944,50019,71703,78787,82102],"name":"Asterix","slug":"asterix","updated_at":1391126400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/asterix","checksum":"2465bdb7-8874-a0fe-0d83-8d305fe1c3de"},"cover":{"id":15818,"game":19486,"height":922,"image_id":"vwhpc1mn6ywdsboohd4n","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vwhpc1mn6ywdsboohd4n.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"c3596708-ca31-175e-c0e6-19dac862d6e1"},"first_release_date":694137600,"franchises":[{"id":58,"created_at":1372464000,"games":[2313,3789,4681,7757,8501,12242,12888,13339,14272,14452,19486,19781,42751,45944,62150,81480,104977,105002,128475],"name":"Asterix","slug":"asterix","updated_at":1372464000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/asterix","checksum":"795789a1-871c-f364-eaf0-6a24ab20e8b7"}],"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"},{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":35979,"company":{"id":4981,"description":"Sega Enterprises was the corporate name of Sega of Japan from the early 1960's to July of 2000.","logo":{"id":3404,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":156,"image_id":"cl2mk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cl2mk.jpg","width":469,"checksum":"9f47e482-8d49-62ff-28ea-de15d2c6d865"},"name":"Sega Enterprises","slug":"sega-enterprises"}}],"name":"Asterix","platforms":[64],"rating":84.9088040062167,"rating_count":7,"release_dates":[{"id":51599,"category":2,"created_at":1465603200,"date":694137600,"game":19486,"human":"1991","m":12,"platform":64,"region":1,"updated_at":1465603200,"y":1991,"checksum":"a16c3f2f-5581-b8a4-6687-4cadbd0e74a7"}],"slug":"asterix--2","summary":"The Romans have kidnapped Getafix, who is the only one that can brew the magic potion the Gauls need to stand against the Romans.
