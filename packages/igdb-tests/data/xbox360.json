Turn 10 Studios began working on the original Forza Motorsport to fill the void of simulation racing games on the Xbox console. With an emphasis on driving mechanics and the newest features of Xbox LIVE, the original Forza Motorsport was released in May of 2005 to much critical acclaim and community support. \n \nBuilding off its success, Turn 10’s team immediately began working on a sequel intended to be released on Microsoft’s new Xbox 360 console. Forza Motorsport 2 was released in May of 2007, pushing the boundaries of User Generated Content (UGC) with a robust livery editor and online Auction House, giving casual players new options for expressing their creativity on and off the track. With new online tools, the Forza community thrived as painters, tuners, seller, and racers shared their creations via Forzamotorsport.net. \n \nIn late 2007, Turn 10 Studios began an intense development process for the next Forza installment. Our most ambitious project to date, Forza Motorsport 3 boasted enhanced graphics, driving physics, and UGC. Turn 10 released the game in October 2009 to critical and commercial success. \n \nReleased in October of 2011, Forza Motorsport 4 brought even more excitement to the franchise with Kinect integration, including the stunning Autovista experience. With hundreds of cars rendered in stunning detail, and new tracks to hone skills on, Forza Motorsport 4 was another resounding success for Turn 10 Studios. \n \nWith Forza Horizon, the Forza universe expanded to the open road. Action racing put the player in an open world that demands driving skill and rewards driving style. With lots to explore and a cutting-edge soundtrack to compliment the scenery, Horizon was an evolution of the authentic Forza experience. \n \nIn 2013, Turn 10 released Forza Motorsport 5, the first Forza Motorsport game to appear on the newest Xbox console, Xbox One.

On each turn a player draws a new terrain tile and places it adjacent to tiles that are already face up. The new tile must be placed in a way that extends features on the tiles it abuts: roads must connect to roads, fields to fields, and cities to cities. \n \n \nA part of a game board after several turns.After placing each new tile, the placing player may opt to station a piece on a feature of that newly-placed tile. The placing player may not use a follower to claim any features of the tile that extend or connect features already claimed by another player. However, it is possible for terrain features claimed by opposing players to become \"shared\" by the subsequent placement of tiles connecting them. For example, two field tiles which each have a follower can become connected into a single field by another terrain tile. \n \nThe game ends when the last tile has been placed. At that time, all features (including fields) score points for the players with the most followers on them. The player with the most points wins the game.","total_rating":75,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/carcassonne"},{"id":1260,"collection":{"id":2950,"created_at":1506556800,"games":[1257,1258,1259,1260,1261,1262,2026,5245,7394,11003,11161,37063,53622,57934,65752,67783],"name":"South Park","slug":"south-park","updated_at":1506556800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/south-park","checksum":"246bbadf-b80d-c0c5-d44d-aabbc5adc5e5"},"cover":{"id":1254,"game":1260,"height":809,"image_id":"jzlltthgflihxkd9voxu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jzlltthgflihxkd9voxu.jpg","width":591,"checksum":"991cba7b-3bcb-2d5e-ea8c-5f5068bc3228"},"first_release_date":1254873600,"franchises":[{"id":28,"created_at":1342915200,"games":[1257,1258,1259,1260,1261,1262,11161,37063],"name":"South Park","slug":"south-park","updated_at":1342915200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/south-park","checksum":"4938486f-b2fe-8ff6-636c-258f43809037"}],"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":5279,"company":{"id":807,"name":"Doublesix","slug":"doublesix"}},{"id":5280,"company":{"id":808,"name":"Xbox Live Production","slug":"xbox-live-production"}},{"id":5281,"company":{"id":809,"logo":{"id":1381,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":340,"image_id":"ojmtxscmuudjeqaqo09o","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ojmtxscmuudjeqaqo09o.jpg","width":739,"checksum":"39c0b9f4-1faf-9c56-cb26-ce020d70416f"},"name":"South Park Digital Studios","slug":"south-park-digital-studios"}},{"id":5282,"company":{"id":53,"logo":{"id":1668,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":330,"image_id":"nbgp6nfrvm9j7zr5uarc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nbgp6nfrvm9j7zr5uarc.jpg","width":630,"checksum":"3733e071-0952-63c3-27d2-4a2e71e4ac01"},"name":"Microsoft Game Studios","slug":"microsoft-game-studios"}}],"name":"South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!","platforms":[12],"rating":87.8682093320381,"rating_count":3,"release_dates":[{"id":196988,"category":0,"created_at":1590364800,"date":1254873600,"game":1260,"human":"Oct 07, 2009","m":10,"platform":12,"region":8,"updated_at":1590364800,"y":2009,"checksum":"f5212471-8e63-f8a7-1a82-8f0ea66e02cf"}],"screenshots":[{"id":1321,"game":1260,"height":562,"image_id":"j2r7kputdf5cfeojwecs","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j2r7kputdf5cfeojwecs.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"9e8f4105-fd98-5b6e-bd05-e7f44dee97e2"},{"id":1322,"game":1260,"height":562,"image_id":"iw37qarjnqpx3bsgaaze","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iw37qarjnqpx3bsgaaze.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"2e1b6d88-8944-199d-567f-f821c5c13b27"},{"id":1323,"game":1260,"height":562,"image_id":"bxybqoa958keui7u3ybm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bxybqoa958keui7u3ybm.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"dc52aac4-55d5-2f61-6733-05863a4f23cb"},{"id":1324,"game":1260,"height":562,"image_id":"pxreqop5zeeafw7mhhvo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pxreqop5zeeafw7mhhvo.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"759fb25b-30b5-813b-308d-d508404e8dd6"},{"id":1325,"game":1260,"height":562,"image_id":"zlzfhxrlteny2tc8ok6v","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zlzfhxrlteny2tc8ok6v.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"543d53a6-fafe-250a-c6de-cff7efcd5d91"}],"slug":"south-park-let-s-go-tower-defense-play","summary":"Play as Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Cartman, or any number of your favorite South Park characters in South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!

The player character is an advanced super-powered officer for the city-funded \"Agency\", known simply as the \"Agent\". This time around, players choose one of four faces and armor colours (eight colours if you preordered it), instead of just the preset heads offered before. Along with that, the orbs have been carried on from the first game, and the Agent's powers are expanded and enhanced such as the Agility Skill which now allows the Agent to jump higher than in Crackdown, glide, and gain access to the helicopter landing pad at the Agency Tower. Driving is also available in Crackdown 2. You’re able to commandeer any number of vehicles in the game, including Agency vehicles, Peacekeeper Cruisers and a large number of civilian vehicles that the Cell have armor plated. Checkpoint races are back, both Road and Rooftop versions. Like Crackdown, the game will allow for on-line co-operative play in the main game, but will now support up to four players. The game will also feature competitive multiplayer modes for up to sixteen players. While the original Crackdown supported System Link playing for co-op, Crackdown 2 won't be featuring the same option.","total_rating":67.75276251117015,"total_rating_count":28,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/crackdown-2"},{"id":20409,"collection":{"id":579,"created_at":1385078400,"games":[496,3199,4797,4798,5924,19521,20409,20933,20938,20940,20942,21611,21764,23907,52871,64627],"name":"Dead Rising","slug":"dead-rising","updated_at":1385078400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/dead-rising","checksum":"b5bf6c28-f219-d6a9-0894-5742788a4fec"},"cover":{"id":48557,"game":20409,"height":796,"image_id":"cqjr3yzvj8aquayu6qnd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cqjr3yzvj8aquayu6qnd.jpg","width":580,"checksum":"2a567c80-daaf-e89d-390b-d958aa988ed7"},"first_release_date":1283212800,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"},{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Dead Rising 2: Case Zero","platforms":[12],"rating":60.0761836075892,"rating_count":11,"release_dates":[{"id":196975,"category":0,"created_at":1590364800,"date":1283212800,"game":20409,"human":"Aug 31, 2010","m":8,"platform":12,"region":1,"updated_at":1590364800,"y":2010,"checksum":"7a9f2d9a-c150-dbc6-40ee-ff4aea7e5a6f"},{"id":196976,"category":0,"created_at":1590364800,"date":1283212800,"game":20409,"human":"Aug 31, 2010","m":8,"platform":12,"region":2,"updated_at":1590364800,"y":2010,"checksum":"821dbbf8-6c49-6a34-76f9-bb651139a780"}],"screenshots":[{"id":27447,"game":20409,"height":352,"image_id":"mdufzb5uyfwvjbuhyovq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mdufzb5uyfwvjbuhyovq.jpg","width":626,"checksum":"105e4939-9863-3218-ebb0-4c618907a31b"}],"slug":"dead-rising-2-case-zero","summary":"Dead Rising 2: Case Zero, will introduce main protagonist and former motocross champion Chuck Greene and provide a link between the original game and the events that await players in the gambling paradise of Fortune City.","total_rating":73.5380918037946,"total_rating_count":15,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dead-rising-2-case-zero"},{"id":7310,"cover":{"id":7513,"game":7310,"height":957,"image_id":"jlavaqjx7k8get9ar6cu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jlavaqjx7k8get9ar6cu.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"b91a92e3-06c4-d6a3-124b-e2ccdddeee26"},"first_release_date":1335312000,"genres":[{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":17286,"company":{"id":60,"name":"Climax Group","slug":"climax-group"}},{"id":17287,"company":{"id":1010,"description":"Established in 2002 as Microsoft Game Studios to coincide with the release of the Xbox.

It is the second installment of the Gears of War series, with lead design by Cliff Bleszinski,. The game was officially released in North America, Europe and Australia on November 7, 2008 and was released in Japan on July 30, 2009. The game expands technically on the previous game by using a modified Unreal Engine 3 engine. The development team brought in comic book writer Joshua Ortega to help write the plot for the game. \n \nIn Gears of War 2, the COG continues its fight against the Locust horde, who are attempting to sink all of the cities on the planet Sera. Sergeant Marcus Fenix leads Delta Squad into the depths of the planet to try to stop the Locust during the assault upon Locust territory. The player controls Fenix in the main mission campaign, with the ability to play cooperatively with a second player controlling Fenix's best friend and fellow Squad member Dominic \"Dom\" Santiago. The game includes several existing and new multiplayer modes including five-on-five battles between human and Locust forces, and a \"Horde\" mode that challenges up to five players against waves of Locust forces with ever-increasing strength. New weapons and gameplay mechanics such as \"chainsaw duels\" and the ability to use downed foes as \"meatshields\" were added to the game. \n \nOn its release weekend, Gears of War 2 sold over two million copies, and within two months of release, had sold four million copies. It was the seventh best selling video game of 2009 and received several accolades. The game received similar praise as its predecessor, with the new gameplay and multiplayer modes seen as outstanding additions.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gears-of-war-2-game-of-the-year-edition"},{"id":21094,"cover":{"id":108897,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":21094,"height":800,"image_id":"co2c0x","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2c0x.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"e4581cc6-5aae-36d0-5cf4-a88462cea016"},"first_release_date":1289001600,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":79537,"company":{"id":53,"logo":{"id":1668,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":330,"image_id":"nbgp6nfrvm9j7zr5uarc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nbgp6nfrvm9j7zr5uarc.jpg","width":630,"checksum":"3733e071-0952-63c3-27d2-4a2e71e4ac01"},"name":"Microsoft Game Studios","slug":"microsoft-game-studios"}},{"id":79538,"company":{"id":1973,"description":"Twisted Pixel is the studio behind the 2009 IGF finalist and 2008 PAX 10 Audience Choice Award winning game The Maw, followed by the award winning Splosion Man, Comic Jumper, Ms. Splosion Man, Kinect exclusive The Gunstringer, and Xbox One launch title LocoCycle.

Set in the fictional Pacific City, the player controls a biologically enhanced Agent, tasked with defeating three crime lords and their organized crime syndicates. The Agent's abilities improve by defeating both crime lords and their supporters, as well as by completing optional activities, such as street races and scavenger hunts. The gameplay is nonlinear: instead of following a rigid mission sequence, players are free to select the approach to completing their missions and activities. The game features a two-player cooperative play mode via Xbox Live. \nCrackdown, initially planned for release on the original Xbox console, was envisioned as a vast world in which players could experiment and explore freely. Microsoft Game Studios bundled specifically marked copies of Crackdown with an access code to the multiplayer test version of the much-anticipated Halo 3 Beta. The game sold 1.5 million copies in its first six months of release because everybody wanted to play Halo 3. It received positive reviews and has garnered several awards for its innovative gameplay. Crackdown was a free download (for Xbox Live Gold members only) from August 1st, 2013 to August 16th, 2013 as part of the Xbox 360 \"Games With Gold\" (Xbox Live) program.","total_rating":78.3823424960968,"total_rating_count":55,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/crackdown"},{"id":47470,"first_release_date":1195776000,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"name":"Clive Barker's Jericho - Special Edition","platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"id":94115,"category":0,"created_at":1500249600,"date":1195776000,"game":47470,"human":"Nov 23, 2007","m":11,"platform":12,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":2007,"checksum":"ce254caf-a1b3-57f8-8d7d-f3158f225947"}],"slug":"clive-barkers-jericho-special-edition","summary":"Sometimes referred to as simply Jericho, is a first person shooter survival horror video game with author Clive Barker providing the premise of the storyline.

Players follow the dance moves of a stylized on-screen figure, as music video clips play and other characters get down in the background. The Kinect camera add-on detects players' whole-body motions, and the software computes the accuracy of their movements to the beat of the current song. In addition to the follow-the-leader single-player challenges, a \"Freestyle\" mode allows players to express themselves with their own custom moves, and multiplayer modes let two dancers go head-to-head. The game's soundtrack includes a variety of 40 popular songs, with contemporary and classic dance hits from artists such as Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Gwen Stefani, Kool & the Gang, Lady Gaga, Lil Wayne, and others.

Six years later, anomalies are detected in the space-time fabric, yet tests reveal nothing out of order, with the portals regularly functioning for both teleportation and time travel; also, the leader of the DonPachi squadron Colonel Godwin Longhener dismisses the matter due to the lack of actual danger. \n \nNevertheless, a technician delves deeper into the anomaly, discovering that something has infiltrated the HQ computer systems and is using the portals to send large quantities of materials and data to the past, spreading out like a virus and quickly evolving. In an ironic twist, the virus is discovered to be the program originally installed in the Element Dolls six years ago, now reaching beyond the DonPachi Corps programming and seeking to annihilate the human race in retaliation for their \"enslavement\" (after the war, they met a rather cruel demise at the hand of their own human creators) by waging war in the past rather than in the present: unsettled, the Colonel authorizes the last transport ship to time jump in order to fight back the invasion before future changes. However, he states: \"Start over from the past... I never thought of that\", echoing the ideas of mankind's imperfection which has always been a recurring theme in the series. \n \nAnd once again, the three pilots jump back in time to 2008 and enter the fray, the transport ship being targeted as soon as it exits the portal: the Element Daughters, gigantic evolutions of the Dolls, are awaiting... \n \nThe bee is still humming.","total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dodonpachi-resurrection-deluxe-edition"},{"id":47444,"first_release_date":1361404800,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Steel Champions","platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"id":94069,"category":0,"created_at":1500249600,"date":1361404800,"game":47444,"human":"Feb 21, 2013","m":2,"platform":12,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":2013,"checksum":"2ba5899a-4fcf-1cc1-80a8-4e901029b209"}],"slug":"steel-champions","summary":"Steel Champions is a first-person perspective boxing game where the main character and other fighters are all robots.

It is the fourth installment in the Forza Motorsport series. It is the first title in the series to support the Kinect sensor alongside the traditional controller-based gameplay. \n \nNew to the series is the Autovista mode, a mode in which players can view precise details such as engine parts and interior gauges on a select number of cars. It features a partnership with BBC's Top Gear as well as its American counterpart. Jeremy Clarkson, presenter for Top Gear, provides commentary in the game's Autovista mode. Other partnerships include a two-year agreement with the American Le Mans Series (ALMS). Over 500 cars and 26 tracks are included. \n \nThe game received universal acclaim from critics. Aggregate websites GameRankings and Metacritic report scores of 90.50% and 91 out of 100, respectively. Metacritic also reports eight perfect scores from various media outlets. Critics praised the enhanced vehicle physics, updated visuals, and strong sound design. Several reviewers also gave high marks for the Forza 4 '​s Autovista mode. Some critics expressed frustration with Kinect features, and others also felt that the game was not enough of an innovation from its predecessor, Forza Motorsport 3. These critics did, however, concede that the game was a vast improvement over Forza 3.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/forza-motorsport-4-essentials-edition"},{"id":20558,"collection":{"id":92,"created_at":1306454400,"games":[504,521,522,694,1592,5624,7658,19388,19906,20438,20558,21328,47415,47477,83837,92550],"name":"Fable","slug":"fable","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/fable","checksum":"e9c132b7-d067-17f3-40bc-724fe30ce2cb"},"first_release_date":1290470400,"name":"Fable III: Understone Quest Pack","platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"id":185540,"category":0,"created_at":1579132800,"date":1290470400,"game":20558,"human":"Nov 23, 2010","m":11,"platform":12,"region":8,"updated_at":1579132800,"y":2010,"checksum":"d5cdd06c-5937-2bea-c6e5-c00361d35343"}],"screenshots":[{"id":27944,"game":20558,"height":720,"image_id":"ntcc7znjqvwaf3um4zkx","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ntcc7znjqvwaf3um4zkx.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"eb766dde-aaff-cc93-9416-2c516c1773a5"}],"slug":"fable-iii-understone-quest-pack","total_rating":60,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/fable-iii-understone-quest-pack"},{"id":41586,"collection":{"id":4159,"created_at":1507852800,"games":[17623,41585,41586,45756,77134],"name":"Rugby League","slug":"rugby-league","updated_at":1507852800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/rugby-league","checksum":"609bfe06-0911-1f66-9794-428bb4c19418"},"cover":{"id":47832,"game":41586,"height":265,"image_id":"lmu905gprwnzgsdpgylo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lmu905gprwnzgsdpgylo.jpg","width":230,"checksum":"bfa01491-5433-5fbb-2896-fa471a5ccc5c"},"first_release_date":1291507200,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Rugby League Live","platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"id":92092,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":1291507200,"game":41586,"human":"Dec 05, 2010","m":12,"platform":12,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":2010,"checksum":"e88e6f06-3a71-8a6b-8321-465dbacf414f"}],"slug":"rugby-league-live","summary":"EU","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rugby-league-live"},{"id":41585,"collection":{"id":4159,"created_at":1507852800,"games":[17623,41585,41586,45756,77134],"name":"Rugby League","slug":"rugby-league","updated_at":1507852800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/rugby-league","checksum":"609bfe06-0911-1f66-9794-428bb4c19418"},"cover":{"id":26588,"game":41585,"height":1598,"image_id":"fgoytjhy9odqilfyexz4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fgoytjhy9odqilfyexz4.jpg","width":1126,"checksum":"758f99a3-9963-8212-0539-cbc2987750a8"},"first_release_date":1356825600,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":63192,"company":{"id":1410,"name":"Tru Blu Entertainment","slug":"tru-blu-entertainment"}}],"name":"Rugby League Live 2","platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"id":92093,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":1356825600,"game":41585,"human":"Dec 30, 2012","m":12,"platform":12,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":2012,"checksum":"62a99480-2822-d0af-9003-7e1c91f339d6"}],"slug":"rugby-league-live-2","summary":"Rugby League Live 2 is a sports game in the Rugby League series of Rugby League video games.

Always keeping the focus on realism, simulation and accessibility, this brand new version is faster, more exciting and with more adrenaline than ever before. \n \nThe driving model has undergone a series of major changes, succeeding in what seemed to be impossible: the game is now more realistic and at the same time it’s easier and more satisfactory for both newbie and seasoned players. Three levels of realism are available to let the player customize their riding experience, building at the same time a smooth learning curve. \n \nPlaying with the Low Sim is perfect to learn the tracks and the bike behavior, Medium Sim model eases the reactions of the powerful SBK bikes, but leaves to the player the possibility of doing incredible late braking maneuvers, Full Sim gives the player the full control of the monster machines of the game. Before getting to the track, the player can set up his bike in the pits using all the options that a real race rider can use. If he doesn’t know how to improve his bike, an engineer is available to do the right fixes based on the player feedback about bike handling. All the player has to do is to tell how handling his bike felt and the engineer will do the setting changes he needs.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sbk-2011-superbike-world-championship"},{"id":47426,"cover":{"id":46831,"game":47426,"height":388,"image_id":"jd7rnr7y1nmfhsa6htpn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jd7rnr7y1nmfhsa6htpn.jpg","width":270,"checksum":"d89e7b15-c0d4-4d0b-9ddd-d4921f791bd5"},"first_release_date":1324080000,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"name":"Nurarihyon

Although controlled by Take-Two, the company remained intact and published games using its own logo as a publishing label.\n\nIn 2002 Global Star Software launched its Global ProBiz lineup of over a dozen business and utility products.

Also included is a second DVD that explores the making of Gears of War with lead designer Cliff Bleszinski and his development team. \n \nAnointed by the games media as Microsoft's first \"killer app\" for its Xbox 360, Epic Games' Gears of War is a futuristic third-person shooter emphasizing tactical action over run-and-gun battles. Players are thrust in a climactic clash between what's left of humankind and a swarming underground race called the Locust Horde. The main protagonist is Marcus Fenix, a once disgraced soldier looking to redeem himself by leading a ragtag squad against the monstrous threat. \n \nSince the alien army vastly outnumbers the team, players must use the post-apocalyptic world to their advantage, such as seeking cover behind dumpsters, pillars, cars, rubble, and other objects. The developer has adapted its award-winning Unreal technology to create interactive environments with a physics-based damage system. Players, for instance, can shoot down structures to forge new routes or opportunities to trap the enemy. Up to three squad mates will accompany Fenix in each mission, with basic commands such as \"advance,\" \"hold,\" or \"freelance\" available to guide them. \n \nA behind-the-shoulder view similar to the one employed in Capcom's Resident Evil 4 is the default perspective in Gears of War. Weapons include an assortment of grenades, pistols, assault rifles, and other long-range blasters, many of which offer a means to engage enemies in melee combat. The Locust Horde is not averse to lunging, rushing, or gnawing at soldiers, so players have the opportunity to perform grisly finishing moves by quickly tapping specific button sequences during close encounters. Cooperative support for two players is offered throughout the campaign, and up to eight can battle each other in team-oriented modes via Xbox Live.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gears-of-war-limited-collectors-edition"},{"id":20245,"cover":{"id":96587,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":20245,"height":292,"image_id":"co22iz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co22iz.jpg","width":219,"checksum":"ec5c05be-5af0-16d0-6fe4-e10496673eb6"},"first_release_date":1326844800,"involved_companies":[{"id":95870,"company":{"id":1010,"description":"Established in 2002 as Microsoft Game Studios to coincide with the release of the Xbox.

The game features characters from both the Street Fighter franchise and Namco's Tekken series. In the game, players select two characters and face other duos in tag team fighting matches, in which the objective is to knock out one of the members from the opposing team. In addition to the game's multiplayer modes, the game also features a single-player Story mode with a plot revolving around a mysterious object called the \"Pandora\". \n \nThe game is the product of a partnership between Namco and Capcom that previously produced the role-playing game Namco × Capcom. As Street Fighter X Tekken was made by Capcom, with Namco being involved more in the licensing of the Tekken cast, the gameplay is based on the 2D gameplay of Street Fighter, with projectile moves such as the Hadouken, as opposed to the Tekken series. Namco is currently producing their own take on the crossover, Tekken X Street Fighter, which will follow their 3D style of gameplay. Unique features in Street Fighter X Tekken include the Gem System, which allows players to equip special gems to power-up various character attributes and Pandora Mode, in which a character's strength and abilities are temporarily augmented. \n \nThe game was well received by critics, who complimented the roster and deep game mechanics. Nevertheless, it fell short of Capcom's sales expectations. In addition, Capcom's release of downloadable content (DLC) for the game was met with criticism when it was revealed that the company was charging for access to characters that were already on the game disc.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/street-fighter-x-tekken-special-edition"},{"id":24236,"first_release_date":1294444800,"name":"Pinball FX 2: Marvel Pinball - Vengeance and Virtue","platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"id":94057,"category":0,"created_at":1500249600,"date":1294444800,"game":24236,"human":"Jan 08, 2011","m":1,"platform":12,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":2011,"checksum":"40d23831-bad8-bd16-9c88-df7ceb5f0a95"}],"slug":"pinball-fx-2-marvel-pinball-vengeance-and-virtue","summary":"Marvel Pinball is an arcade pinball video game developed by Zen Studios.

The games were developed by the same team who are responsible for the Street Fighter III series. \n \nIt was originally released in the arcade in 1998 on the CPS-3 arcade system; this version was known outside Japan as JoJo's Venture. An updated version of the game was released in 1999 as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future (ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 未来への遺産 JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken Mirai e no Isan?), becoming the sixth and last game released for the CPS-3 board. Console ports for the PlayStation and Dreamcast were also released that year. A high-definition version of the game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in August 2012.[1] \n \nThe game combines Capcom's trademark anime-inspired graphics, as seen in the Darkstalkers series, with the colorful characters and events of Hirohiko Araki's creation, resulting in a highly stylized and detailed visual style. It also features many of the gameplay mechanics seen on previous Capcom fighting games, such as the use of power gauges for super moves, as well as a brand new Stand Mode, consisting of the series' signature guardian spirits that accompanies almost every character and can be summoned or dismissed at will by the player, resulting in variations in the character's move list and abilities. \n \nOriginal author Hirohiko Araki served as a consultant for the game and created exclusive pieces of artwork for its promotion and packaging; most notably, he developed from scratch a new character design for Midler, since Capcom was interested in using her in the game and she had been only vaguely shown in the original manga.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/jojos-bizarre-adventure-hd--1"},{"id":7130,"collection":{"id":967,"created_at":1401321600,"games":[7130,11324],"name":"Phantom Breaker","slug":"phantom-breaker","updated_at":1401321600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/phantom-breaker","checksum":"02720a15-da84-4bfc-f952-42c1b3fa9a23"},"cover":{"id":7301,"game":7130,"height":355,"image_id":"qwqiodf2z3sqyld1yi8r","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qwqiodf2z3sqyld1yi8r.jpg","width":250,"checksum":"c7b571fe-6fa8-b496-0e16-ef951ee7f98d"},"first_release_date":1306972800,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":24635,"company":{"id":2428,"description":"Five Powered &amp; basics","logo":{"id":116,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":40,"image_id":"daqw6lgqxyw5pkv1bziw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/daqw6lgqxyw5pkv1bziw.jpg","width":200,"checksum":"7fa4743e-fa60-594a-c9a0-a0ab66a3cad6"},"name":"5pb.","slug":"5pb"}},{"id":24636,"company":{"id":3001,"name":"Delta Factory","slug":"delta-factory"}},{"id":24637,"company":{"id":3002,"name":"R.U.N.","slug":"r-u-n"}},{"id":24638,"company":{"id":3000,"name":"7Sixty","slug":"7sixty"}}],"name":"Phantom Breaker","platforms":[12],"rating":85,"rating_count":0,"release_dates":[{"id":17981,"category":0,"created_at":1401321600,"date":1306972800,"game":7130,"human":"Jun 02, 2011","m":6,"platform":12,"region":5,"updated_at":1401321600,"y":2011,"checksum":"12138d9e-1db1-3ce7-dd23-d46d3a890b03"},{"id":31272,"category":0,"created_at":1436227200,"date":1339459200,"game":7130,"human":"Jun 12, 2012","m":6,"platform":12,"region":2,"updated_at":1436400000,"y":2012,"checksum":"78a56dce-c7ec-64dc-6c19-736e8d72094f"}],"slug":"phantom-breaker","summary":"A 2D Fighting game loosely based on characters from the visual novel Chaos;Head.","total_rating":85,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/phantom-breaker"},{"id":45146,"collection":{"id":173,"created_at":1319932800,"games":[740,986,987,989,990,991,2640,3122,6803,7348,20855,24782,41608,43954,43955,45144,45145,45146,45147,45148,45149,75413,77343,103281,117289,117290],"name":"Halo","slug":"halo","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/halo","checksum":"b1b8f53c-e58e-9d1c-d5ee-76ae5a214986"},"cover":{"id":27093,"game":45146,"height":1500,"image_id":"ojgz9g1bo9tk1h5k2uod","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ojgz9g1bo9tk1h5k2uod.jpg","width":1011,"checksum":"fdf2de92-3e3e-fcad-3ed1-d33a99eb690e"},"first_release_date":1287014400,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":57130,"company":{"id":620,"description":"Bungie was founded in 1991 with two goals: develop kick ass games that combine state-of-the-art technology with uncompromising art, captivating storytelling, and deep gameplay, and then to sell enough copies to fund their ongoing quest for World Domination.

Players must deal with the fallout from the devastating attacks on U.S. and British soil in a storyline that picks up where 2009's Modern Warfare 2 left off. The single-player campaign has you battling Russian ultranationalists, led by Vladimir Markov, as members of the U.S. Delta Force and British SAS. You'll battle across war-torn areas of New York City, London, Paris, Mogadishu, Dubai, and other regions as you prepare to end the global threat once and for all. \n \nAs with previous entries in the Call of Duty series, Modern Warfare 3's campaign features a heavily scripted, cinematic experience with Hollywood-style special effects. One new mission, for example, has you involved in underwater travel with a sonar-equipped submersible watercraft. You'll then fight inside an enemy-controlled submarine before guiding an inflatable raft across turbulent waters while a naval battle rages nearby. Other sequences have you firing mounted guns, driving vehicles, and more while explosions light up the landscape. \n \nReturning to the game is the cooperative Spec Ops mode that features a series of standalone missions on different maps. New to Spec Ops is a survival option that has you and either a friend or a computer partner battling waves of enemy forces. Shooting down enemies earns you cash, which can be used to purchase new perks, items, weapons, and other upgrades. You'll also be able to earn bonuses by working together as a team and maintaining kill streaks. \n \nThe heart of the game is once again the 18-player online component, which introduces all-new maps and a variety of enhancements to the format introduced in Modern Warfare 2. Popular features such as kill-streak awards, experience points, weapons-based achievements, and perks return, allowing you to customize your character as you progress.

While magic energy existed in all living creatures beforehand, it suddenly became far more powerful thirty years before the beginning of the game. Because of this, it has affected society greatly, with devices called \"Magic Engines\" harnessing this power for lighting, automobiles, communication, and robots, among other uses. While previously only a select few could wield magic, many magicians gained the ability. However, such progress has also caused two nations to develop new and more powerful weapons of mass destruction. The kingdom of Gohtza and the Republic of Uhra (which recently converted from a monarchy). Uhra is building Grand Staff, a gigantic magic engine, while the heavily industrialized Gohtza actively pursues magic research of their own. A third nation, the Free Ocean State of Numara, remains isolated and neutral, though it is falling into disarray due to a general attempting to stage a coup d'etat. Uhra, at war with Khent, a nation of beastmen, sends its forces to the Highlands of Wohl for a decisive battle at the start of the game.","total_rating":74.70637218461685,"total_rating_count":34,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/lost-odyssey"},{"id":21915,"cover":{"id":63326,"game":21915,"height":349,"image_id":"zwb43d9xfss9uiw6b2wt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zwb43d9xfss9uiw6b2wt.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"02cbace1-db6c-5909-7b23-7318f44eb9f2"},"first_release_date":1178323200,"name":"Pinball FX","platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"id":147789,"category":0,"created_at":1518739200,"date":1178323200,"game":21915,"human":"May 05, 2007","m":5,"platform":12,"region":8,"updated_at":1518739200,"y":2007,"checksum":"c164e7e8-a9a7-a376-ac47-8de14a9ced6d"}],"screenshots":[{"id":29622,"game":21915,"height":270,"image_id":"ybmb7enlxgijgns0ibvs","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ybmb7enlxgijgns0ibvs.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"acb0af59-2c6b-115b-563b-6130e6448576"}],"slug":"pinball-fx","summary":"Pinball FX is a pinball machine video game for the Xbox 360.

It was released on Xbox 360 on 22 November 2005 in North America, 10 December 2005 in Japan, and 20 January 2006 in Europe. \n \n \nLike previous Ridge Racer titles, the focus of gameplay is on placing first out of 14 in numerous 3-lap races across several tracks and numerous cars. In most races, the player can earn up to three nitrous boosts by successfully drifting around corners without crashing, which can then be used to give the player a short burst of speed. Some races are labeled as \"no-nitrous,\" which prevent the player from earning any nitrous during the race, though the player can optionally enable nitrous. If the player wins using this option, the race is considered complete, but noted for breaking the no-nitrous rule. Some races are also Duels between the player and a boss opponent, who is usually equipped with a much better car than the player can select from. \n \nRidge Racer 6 introduces a career-mode \"World Xplorer,\" a branching-tree arrangement of races in which the player can only attempt races next to a race that has already been successfully completed. The layout of the races in the Xplorer is such that the position of a race will indicate what class of car can be used (horizontal position) and the difficulty of the course (vertical position). Rewards can be obtained by completing certain races or completing all races that enclose an area on the Xplorer, and usually offers new cars but also include additional variations of the tracks (mirroring and reverse) or new branches added to the tree. A player can also engage in quick races and time challenges for any track and car that has been unlocked. \n \nThere are thirty new circuits available including \"Surfside Resort\" and \"Harborline 765.\" Also, there are around 130 cars (including 10 special). Online multiplayer is possible with up to 14 players racing against each other and downloadable content is available via Microsoft's Xbox Live service. Players can download another player's \"ghost\" replay from Xbox Live and attempt to beat it. \n \nLike other Ridge Racer games, this iteration goes beyond cars to feature other outlandish vehicles as well, called \"special machines\" in the game. These include a hovercraft (Assoluto Pronzione), a tripod supercar (Himmel 490B) and an oversized SUV that can be very loud (Danver Bass Cruiser).[1] The game, as with all games in the Ridge Racer series, contains copious amount of references to other Namco games, such as Pac-Man, Soulcalibur, and Ace Combat. \n \nThe game also features a Full Motion Video opening, starring series mascot Reiko Nagase. \n \nIn Japan, Namco announced that it expected to sell 500,000 copies of Ridge Racer 6 for the Xbox 360, although far fewer copies were actually sold. Ridge Racer 7 for the PlayStation 3 is something of a \"director's cut\"/\"final version\" of Ridge Racer 6, but with major differences such as new vehicles that were not seen in Ridge Racer 6 such as Sinseong, a Korean brand.","total_rating":82.39184092115104,"total_rating_count":6,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ridge-racer-6"},{"id":7059,"cover":{"id":7231,"game":7059,"height":355,"image_id":"evwonb196qe3du4vevsp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/evwonb196qe3du4vevsp.jpg","width":252,"checksum":"bed1ac85-35fd-894f-d5e8-f65295dfca9f"},"first_release_date":1147824000,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":16691,"company":{"id":263,"logo":{"id":79,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":120,"image_id":"b48ufwml6vyzdgcofk2h","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b48ufwml6vyzdgcofk2h.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"3e75f024-8366-2b46-3a5c-288f82169e33"},"name":"Namco","slug":"namco"}}],"name":"Love Football","platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"id":17685,"category":0,"created_at":1401235200,"date":1147824000,"game":7059,"human":"May 17, 2006","m":5,"platform":12,"region":5,"updated_at":1401235200,"y":2006,"checksum":"ecac51c4-45f1-ac32-f174-760be09b495e"}],"slug":"love-football","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/love-football"},{"id":1319,"collection":{"id":66,"created_at":1301443200,"games":[492,547,548,1319,11186,16605,20656,41599,41613,41627,47384,47456,47465,47489,51540,103290,103291,103292],"name":"Gears of War","slug":"gears-of-war","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/gears-of-war","checksum":"5faafe61-434a-d304-8a44-53025a6ba2c4"},"cover":{"id":109858,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":1319,"height":2131,"image_id":"co2crm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2crm.jpg","width":1598,"checksum":"8dcc9a75-ea6f-b7d9-2723-db9aff48ad53"},"first_release_date":1363651200,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":3856,"company":{"id":167,"name":"People Can Fly","slug":"people-can-fly"}},{"id":52158,"company":{"id":1010,"description":"Established in 2002 as Microsoft Game Studios to coincide with the release of the Xbox.

In addition to missiles and a vulcan cannon, the player can equip special weapons such as heat-seeking missiles, bombs, rocket launchers, and others. The player can lock on to a number of foes, and assist different tactical squads by switching between their respective HUD readouts. \n \nThe game includes 4 default multiplayer modes: Battle Royale, Siege Battle, Team Battle, and Co-Op Battle. In Battle Royale, the basic Deathmatch game mode, up to sixteen players shoot each other down to earn the highest points at the time limit. In Team Battle, a basic Team Deathmatch game is created. Points are awarded based on the type of aircraft destroyed. A unique type of multiplayer game, Siege Battle is played with two teams, Attacking and Defending. The Attacking team attempts to destroy the target (usually heavily defended by flak) within the time limit. The Defending team tries to halt their attack. The co-op battle mode consists of two single-player missions without AI that can be played with up to three other players.","total_rating":85.18997409311895,"total_rating_count":20,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ace-combat-6-fires-of-liberation"},{"id":20414,"collection":{"id":2256,"created_at":1468627200,"games":[2125,20414],"name":"Darkstar One","slug":"darkstar-one","updated_at":1468627200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/darkstar-one","checksum":"f55be823-cb5d-7b57-3717-8876d025fa66"},"cover":{"id":55263,"game":20414,"height":1493,"image_id":"km6ftmdfgdbw23ymer20","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/km6ftmdfgdbw23ymer20.jpg","width":1083,"checksum":"d5c7e8c0-ed1f-a18c-84a4-a86dce0b2a2a"},"first_release_date":1213747200,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":59635,"company":{"id":3006,"logo":{"id":1981,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":180,"image_id":"cl1j1","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cl1j1.jpg","width":180,"checksum":"83bad0aa-9453-f069-884d-e5daee3accff"},"name":"Gaming Minds Studios","slug":"gaming-minds-studios"}},{"id":59636,"company":{"id":783,"description":"Kalypso Media is a German game developer and publisher founded in 2006 by Simon Hellwig and Stefan Marcinek.

Awakening in the Otherworld, Windia arrives in a Western city reminiscent of the early 20th century, and is cared for by Dior, an elderly lord. \n \nDiscovering there is no way home, Dior reveals to Windia that she is one of the ‘lost children’, those with magical powers chosen to protect the kingdom. Known as ‘Angels’ by the people and beloved for their bravery, Angels protect the peace and ensure a good life for all. \n \nHowever, the gates of Hell are overflowing, allowing monsters to cross the planes and attack human beings. It is up to Windia and her new sisters to defend the city and purge the evil menace. \n \nDeathsmiles is a side-scrolling shoot –em-up that went into arcade operation on October 19th 2007, and was later released on the Japanese Xbox 360 in March 2009. Unlike other shooting games, Deathsmiles is designed with a left/right shooting mechanic, surrounding you with enemy units and gunfire from both sides of the screen. The player will need to employ strategy and think about enemy positioning as your shots may be blocked by obstacles. \n \nDeathsmiles features a selectable difficulty level that allows you to choose how to proceed through the game, ensuring that newcomers are as welcome as veterans. Different stories and conversations will appear during both single player and two-player cooperative play and depends on the character(s)

The game uses Valve's proprietary Source engine, and is available for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and Mac OS X. Development on the game was completed on November 13, 2008, and two versions were released digitally: A downloadable digital version, released on November 17, 2008, and a digital retail disc version, with a release date determined by region. The digital retail disc version was released in North America and Australia on November 18, 2008; and in Europe and Japan on November 21, 2008. \n \nSet during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, the game pits its four protagonists—dubbed the \"Survivors\"—against hordes of the infected. There are four game modes: a single-player mode in which allied characters are controlled by AI; a four-player, co-op campaign mode; an eight-player online versus mode; and a four-player survival mode. In all modes, an artificial intelligence (AI), dubbed the \"Director\", controls level pacing and item placements, in an attempt to create a dynamic experience and increase replay value. \n \nLeft 4 Dead was well received by the industry media upon its release, with praise given for its replay value, focus on cooperative play, and movie-like experience. Several criticisms were aimed at limited level selection and the lack of a narrative. The game has won several publication awards, as well as distinctions from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences and British Academy of Film and Television Arts. As was done with Team Fortress 2, Valve supplemented the game with free downloadable content. The first, called the \"Survival Pack\", was released on April 21, 2009. The second piece of DLC was charged for on Xbox Live and came in the form of a new Campaign entitled \"Crash Course,\" released for both the PC and Xbox 360 on September 29, 2009. \n \nThe popularity of the game led to the development of a sequel, Left 4 Dead 2, which was released November 17, 2009. Left 4 Dead 2 was released on Mac OS X via Steam on October 5, 2010, and the original Left 4 Dead was released for the Mac soon after on October 28, 2010. The Mac version of Left 4 Dead 2 incorporated a new map for both Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2, called \"The Sacrifice\".

Standing in front of the Kinect sensor, players compete by mimicking actions performed in real-life sports, such as throwing a javelin or kicking a football.","total_rating":68.72978431945509,"total_rating_count":17,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kinect-sports"},{"id":18026,"collection":{"id":1107,"created_at":1417996800,"games":[4842,17478,18026,64318,64319,64365],"name":"Kinect Sports","slug":"kinect-sports","updated_at":1417996800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/kinect-sports","checksum":"d4fad6c9-9a3a-8f65-930c-3915d542fa8d"},"cover":{"id":96909,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":18026,"height":947,"image_id":"co22rx","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co22rx.jpg","width":710,"checksum":"e3180272-5b75-d753-c93b-6154f26624ed"},"first_release_date":1319500800,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":33097,"company":{"id":771,"logo":{"id":1265,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":365,"image_id":"feggrbspqjrkyggtagei","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/feggrbspqjrkyggtagei.jpg","width":270,"checksum":"940726dd-de73-2c95-f779-8d6681c0ee92"},"name":"Rare","slug":"rare"}},{"id":33098,"company":{"id":1256,"name":"BigPark","slug":"bigpark"}},{"id":33099,"company":{"id":1010,"description":"Established in 2002 as Microsoft Game Studios to coincide with the release of the Xbox.

After EA Sports' rival publisher 2K Sports cancelled its own college basketball game, College Hoops, in 2008, EA changed the name of the series from NCAA March Madness to NCAA College Basketball. The series was discontinued on February 10, 2010.[1] \n \nLike other games based on NCAA sports, it could not feature the players' names (as that is against NCAA policy/rules), so only the players' numbers were used in the rosters. Users were able to edit the rosters, putting in the correct names for each team if they wished to do so. Many player last names were built into the in-game commentary, like in the NBA Live series. \n \nVerne Lundquist, Brad Nessler, and Gus Johnson lent their voices for play-by-play in the games at various times. Lundquist was the original announcer, with Nessler taking over in the mid-2000s and Johnson joining him for the most recent game in the series. Bill Raftery and Dick Vitale were analysts. Raftery originally worked with Lundquist on their games and returned to work alongside Johnson for CBS-branded games in NCAA Basketball 10, while Vitale and Nessler joined the series at the same time","total_rating":68.5,"total_rating_count":3,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ncaa-march-madness-07"},{"id":45148,"collection":{"id":173,"created_at":1319932800,"games":[740,986,987,989,990,991,2640,3122,6803,7348,20855,24782,41608,43954,43955,45144,45145,45146,45147,45148,45149,75413,77343,103281,117289,117290],"name":"Halo","slug":"halo","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/halo","checksum":"b1b8f53c-e58e-9d1c-d5ee-76ae5a214986"},"cover":{"id":44032,"game":45148,"height":688,"image_id":"seizoi6iwekcw8b0wlmc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/seizoi6iwekcw8b0wlmc.jpg","width":426,"checksum":"0a3fe316-a358-3876-a913-741571a8eabb"},"first_release_date":1352160000,"franchises":[{"id":137,"created_at":1383696000,"games":[740,986,987,988,989,990,991,2640,3122,4839,6803,7348,7849,11570,20855,24782,26183,26731,37383,41608,43955,43956,45144,45145,45147,45148,45149,60459,72766,75413,75417,102066,103281],"name":"Halo","slug":"halo","updated_at":1383696000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/halo","checksum":"153a9db0-10d8-e7dd-9a63-ebe9ba8ed98b"}],"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":57118,"company":{"id":722,"logo":{"id":2118,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":437,"image_id":"cl1mu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cl1mu.jpg","width":1200,"checksum":"fb4e5738-2c40-c3ec-e4a4-39c4e3cbce4a"},"name":"343 Industries","slug":"343-industries"}},{"id":57119,"company":{"id":1010,"description":"Established in 2002 as Microsoft Game Studios to coincide with the release of the Xbox.

PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game were released August 26, 2014. \n \nThe game is set in a post-apocalyptic Moscow, part of the universe of the novel Metro 2033 and its sequels, written by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky, but does not follow any direct storylines from the books. Previously announced as Metro 2034, the game is a sequel to the video game Metro 2033, and although Glukhovsky did work with developer 4A Games, it bears no relation to the book Metro 2034. Rumors on his website point to the upcoming book, Metro 2035, to be a novelization of Metro: Last Light, but it will cover the plot and dialogue in much greater detail and length. \n \nInitially, the game was to be published under THQ and expected to be released in the middle of 2012; it was announced on February 2, 2012, that the game would be delayed until the first quarter of 2013, and on March 1, 2013 the game was delayed again until May. Following THQ's closure in January 2013, the intellectual property was acquired by video game publisher Deep Silver. \n \nMetro: Last Light received positive reviews from critics. Praise was directed at the game's story (including its atmosphere, presentation, and environments), graphics (especially on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One), and the improvements made over Metro 2033 (such as the controls, gunplay, sound, and stealth mechanics). The game did, however, draw some criticism for its linear sequences, AI, and technical issues.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/metro-last-light-limited-edition"},{"id":6456,"collection":{"id":910,"created_at":1398470400,"games":[6453,6454,6455,6456,6457,6458,6459,6460,6462,26991,68242,77545,109458],"name":"Katamari Damacy","slug":"katamari-damacy","updated_at":1398470400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/katamari-damacy","checksum":"0413b14f-a7cc-da1e-8c7e-9bd93cafdc02"},"cover":{"id":6641,"game":6456,"height":1079,"image_id":"upmowvjlhluj5xec4ax4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/upmowvjlhluj5xec4ax4.jpg","width":765,"checksum":"1dd2091f-8c40-6170-cfcd-6aa57a5ca860"},"first_release_date":1192492800,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":15364,"company":{"id":263,"logo":{"id":79,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":120,"image_id":"b48ufwml6vyzdgcofk2h","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b48ufwml6vyzdgcofk2h.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"3e75f024-8366-2b46-3a5c-288f82169e33"},"name":"Namco","slug":"namco"}},{"id":15365,"company":{"id":1976,"logo":{"id":2606,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":59,"image_id":"cl20e","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cl20e.jpg","width":191,"checksum":"d8ef24d5-677e-2f93-eeb8-c1fbfff2e3aa"},"name":"NOW Production","slug":"now-production"}},{"id":15366,"company":{"id":248,"description":"Bandai and NAMCO have both fundamentally been entertainment companies.

A title that announced Team17's arrival as a quality indie developer-publisher... quite some years before they had a hit with those little pink blighters, WormsTM.\n\nThe game was an instant success and a sequel of sorts, Alien Breed Directors Cut, released in 1992 spending an incredible 33 unbroken weeks at the top of the UK Gallup Budget Charts. A full sequel was released in 1993 (Alien Breed 2) and a 3D edition, which won a number of technical achievement awards in 1994.

The Xbox 360 exclusive is available on the Xbox Live Marketplace for 800 Microsoft Points.[38] The game features Frank West, the main character from the first Dead Rising game, and serves as the canon Overtime Mode of Dead Rising 2, with Frank teaming up with Chuck to further investigate the link between Phenotrans and the Fortune City zombie outbreak, and find proof that clears Chuck of any wrongdoing.[39] \n \nThe story follows on from Ending A of the main game, with Frank rescuing Chuck from the elevator. Frank was going to meet Rebecca Chang to investigate a Phenotrans facility west of Fortune City, but learns from Chuck that she was killed by Phenotrans mole Sullivan. Although initially suspicious of Chuck because of the media reports blaming him for the Fortune City outbreak, Frank lets the motocross star come with him to find proof that Phenotrans was behind the outbreak. \n \nCase West includes cooperative play for two players, with each taking control of one of the two characters. The episode features new challenges, enemies, items, combo weapons. The photography element returns from the first Dead Rising; the characters use this to generate proof of Phenotrans' part in the zombie outbreaks.[40] Case West was released on December 27, 2010.[38] \n \nCase West received generally positive reviews, with a score of 74 on Metacritic. IGN gave the title an 8.5 out of 10 rating, with praise for the story, combo weapons, and fun co-op mode. Eurogamer gave the title an 8 out of 10 rating, stating that the product was more a worthwhile purchase for people planning to play co-op with a friend. GameTrailers awarded the title with a 7.9 out of 10 rating, saying that the $10 asking price was worth it. GameSpot gave the title a 7 out of 10 rating, praising the new weapons, fun while rescuing survivors, wacky humor, and plenty of replay value, but criticizing the similarity it has to Case Zero, no integration with previous games, and that the photography in the game has less impact than in Dead Rising.","total_rating":60.0376452910957,"total_rating_count":6,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dead-rising-2-case-west"},{"id":6937,"cover":{"id":90962,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":6937,"height":800,"image_id":"co1y6q","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1y6q.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"56917795-de1a-cd03-4413-9e70e023bb14"},"first_release_date":1151539200,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":16404,"company":{"id":112,"description":"As one of the leading interactive entertainment companies, SEGA cultivates creative talent worldwide with offices in America, Japan and our European HQ in London.

With new online tools, the Forza community thrived as painters, tuners, seller, and racers shared their creations via Forzamotorsport.net. \n \nIn late 2007, Turn 10 Studios began an intense development process for the next Forza installment. Our most ambitious project to date, Forza Motorsport 3 boasted enhanced graphics, driving physics, and UGC.

Action racing put the player in an open world that demands driving skill and rewards driving style. With lots to explore and a cutting-edge soundtrack to compliment the scenery, Horizon was an evolution of the authentic Forza experience. \n \nIn 2013, Turn 10 released Forza Motorsport 5, the first Forza Motorsport game to appear on the newest Xbox console, Xbox One. Featuring astonishing graphics and cutting-edge features like cloud-powered Drivatar opponents, Forza Motorsport 5 is a landmark racing game that defined the next generation of consoles and continues to appeal to Xbox fans across the world. \n \nForza Horizon 2 was released in 2014, featuring the wide-open spaces of Southern Europe to explore in hundreds of realistic, real-world cars. With a full day-night cycle and dramatic weather effects, Forza Horizon 2 was hailed by fans and critics alike for its beautiful visuals and emphasis on pure fun.

Like Sony's Gran Turismo franchise, Forza games are racing simulations; heavy emphasis is placed on making the cars drive and look as realistic as possible. Races are conducted on closed circuit tracks. 500 cars are featured in the core game experience, ranging from road cars to race cars. \n \nPlayers can utilize Kinect to look into a corner using a new head tracking feature. This allows them to look toward the apex of a corner or at nearby cars. The controller or steering wheel is used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players can also use Kinect as a game controller. In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player's vehicle utilizing a modified version of the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3. The steering is controlled by placing the players arms out as if controlling an invisible steering wheel. Kinect will allow the player to use voice commands to start races and navigate menus.","total_rating":84.80398850621845,"total_rating_count":53,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/forza-motorsport-4"},{"id":522,"collection":{"id":92,"created_at":1306454400,"games":[504,521,522,694,1592,5624,7658,19388,19906,20438,20558,21328,47415,47477,83837,92550],"name":"Fable","slug":"fable","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/fable","checksum":"e9c132b7-d067-17f3-40bc-724fe30ce2cb"},"cover":{"id":90809,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":522,"height":1040,"image_id":"co1y2h","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1y2h.jpg","width":780,"checksum":"68490804-d4c1-9ef5-7a08-75801dcf51a2"},"first_release_date":1224547200,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":1270,"company":{"id":6,"logo":{"id":80,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":640,"image_id":"uqfb68yonnvrhwwqdzzp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uqfb68yonnvrhwwqdzzp.jpg","width":587,"checksum":"aeeebaa0-7576-802e-fb78-bc32c36e3ab1"},"name":"Lionhead Studios","slug":"lionhead-studios"}},{"id":1271,"company":{"id":53,"logo":{"id":1668,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":330,"image_id":"nbgp6nfrvm9j7zr5uarc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nbgp6nfrvm9j7zr5uarc.jpg","width":630,"checksum":"3733e071-0952-63c3-27d2-4a2e71e4ac01"},"name":"Microsoft Game Studios","slug":"microsoft-game-studios"}}],"name":"Fable II","platforms":[12],"rating":77.1958972564525,"rating_count":139,"release_dates":[{"id":128322,"category":0,"created_at":1510617600,"date":1224547200,"game":522,"human":"Oct 21, 2008","m":10,"platform":12,"region":2,"updated_at":1510617600,"y":2008,"checksum":"700d3772-c578-644c-2893-b52a334c6a63"},{"id":128323,"category":0,"created_at":1510617600,"date":1224720000,"game":522,"human":"Oct 23, 2008","m":10,"platform":12,"region":3,"updated_at":1510617600,"y":2008,"checksum":"f9cfbbce-9892-e54e-24c7-324d8d4fbf8b"},{"id":128324,"category":0,"created_at":1510617600,"date":1224806400,"game":522,"human":"Oct 24, 2008","m":10,"platform":12,"region":1,"updated_at":1510617600,"y":2008,"checksum":"dd788754-d329-48a2-fcef-88bdaf4ae8ca"}],"screenshots":[{"id":20851,"game":522,"height":720,"image_id":"nnelew7ho3kgrjqcuvxb","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nnelew7ho3kgrjqcuvxb.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"e97fe190-d5e3-963e-d5ca-59c7c72898cd"},{"id":20852,"game":522,"height":720,"image_id":"se2jirr9zac2ac1jwnxe","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/se2jirr9zac2ac1jwnxe.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"e96956d2-2dfd-0699-f4e9-0e80bc542623"},{"id":20853,"game":522,"height":720,"image_id":"murhcqwamhua3i24u43l","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/murhcqwamhua3i24u43l.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"80952d3e-e9a5-abf2-ab06-a5c5d988cd96"},{"id":20854,"game":522,"height":720,"image_id":"gbauz25dnqerjflndb2r","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gbauz25dnqerjflndb2r.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"0149ff31-5690-68d3-2fd8-1a7179f9f6e9"},{"id":20855,"game":522,"height":720,"image_id":"ovwainfhs2tof6aod0or","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ovwainfhs2tof6aod0or.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"3b573e38-e860-b5e4-dce7-41cb1c292743"}],"slug":"fable-ii","summary":"Fable 2 is the second game in the fable series by Lionhead Studios, it is an open world role-playing game.
