The game was released by Konami in 1993, only in Japan. The game was re-released in 1998 through the Nintendo Power service, adding Super Game Boy support and featuring a bestiary for encountered monsters; this version was called God Medicine Hukkokuban. \n \nA video gaming company was to release Phantom, their new RPG, but the company mysteriously is destroyed. Noah, Ken, and Miki are three RPG fans that are disappointed by this. Wandering about, they stumble upon a shack with a great demon inside, battling three warriors. The warriors are defeated and the demon exits through a portal. The warriors give their souls and powers to the three RPG fans, who now must enter Phantom to save the game's world. However, they must also protect the real world from the demon. \n \nGod Medicine features standard RPG elements. The three characters can level up through battle and equip weapons and armor. Spells can be learned, as well as Maphu attacks. After the party collects Maphu gems and gains the special Maphu weapons, they can put the gems in the weapons.

While there is a released Pinocchio game for the Game Boy mono, “Adventures of…” is a completely different title and Bit Managers never listed this one on their homepage, only Ottifanten. A playable version of this beta was leaked online, and it’s often confused for an official released game. Trying out the game shows that you cannot lose any lives – the counter won’t work. This is no final release and there is none because it’s an unreleased game. \n \nAs we can read in a Wikipedia entry, the game relies on 115 separate levels of puzzle action, played by viewing the playing field in isometric projection. Pinocchio’s main objective is to get to the arrow (the exit) on the screen in order to move onto the next level. If the player is able to navigate Pinocchio to the objective before the timer runs out, he gets a certain number of points equal to the time left. Once this number reaches 500, the Fairy will bestow Pinocchio with an extra life. \n \nA closer look at the dump floating around will reveal a weird internal name “Infrey Quest”, so we can speculate that before Pinocchio and Ottifanten, Bit Managers tried to develop their own original IP. When they did not find any publisher interested in Infrey Quest, they changed the game in Pinocchio and later into Ottifanten, with their more recognized characters. \n \nOttifanten uses the same game concept as well and the same music as Adventure of Pinocchio. It even looks like the basic stage design is the same.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-adventures-of-pinocchio"},{"id":134833,"collection":{"id":3175,"created_at":1507161600,"games":[28089,43886,44968,46664,46695,49331,50027,50953,56991,134833],"name":"Lucky Luke","slug":"lucky-luke","updated_at":1507161600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/lucky-luke","checksum":"a6b7f062-0ef7-f69a-d14e-a6fa25b7bae0"},"cover":{"id":105933,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":134833,"height":638,"image_id":"co29ql","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co29ql.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"7ffc8274-3042-c7d7-0d9b-79262fbc7457"},"first_release_date":851990400,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"name":"Lucky Luke","platforms":[33],"release_dates":[{"id":199939,"category":2,"created_at":1592092800,"date":851990400,"game":134833,"human":"1996","m":12,"platform":33,"region":1,"updated_at":1592092800,"y":1996,"checksum":"0bdcdd08-123c-184a-82ab-38f728041ece"}],"screenshots":[{"id":388555,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":134833,"height":286,"image_id":"sc8bt7","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8bt7.jpg","width":317,"checksum":"827a3d69-c5be-a258-0c71-509d08ecf0f2"},{"id":388556,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":134833,"height":286,"image_id":"sc8bt8","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8bt8.jpg","width":317,"checksum":"6f2776c5-4984-50a8-90b2-1e775bd8bc06"}],"slug":"lucky-luke--2","summary":"EXPERIENCE THE FIRST AND FASTEST 3D COWBOY ADVENTURE IN THE WEST! \nRoller-coaster rides on an old mine wagon, saloon bar brawls, weird adventures in Indian territory...","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/lucky-luke--2"},{"id":106669,"cover":{"id":67570,"game":106669,"height":1440,"image_id":"ydgr60uyvduk6odiy6xh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ydgr60uyvduk6odiy6xh.jpg","width":1824,"checksum":"eb1fbe54-47e3-9436-f0c5-8fb785cb4a85"},"involved_companies":[{"id":68334,"company":{"id":1126,"name":"Sachen","slug":"sachen"}}],"name":"4-in-1 Version 9","platforms":[33],"release_dates":[{"id":156389,"category":7,"created_at":1532908800,"game":106669,"human":"TBD","platform":33,"region":8,"updated_at":1533081600,"checksum":"9a96fe77-c38f-39a3-f3c9-378a7f596801"}],"slug":"4-in-1-version-9","summary":"4 -in 1 Volume 9 was the ninth volume of 4-in-1 multicarts made by Sachen.

You'll control every move of Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael as they arm themselves with head-rattling Nunchakus, back-stabbing Sai Swords, and liver-lashing Katana Blades. Of course, this once in a light year adventure will really start rumbling the nanosecond you bust into 5 never-before-seen levels of Manhattan mayhem, including the Traffic Jam, Waste Dump Ravine and Technodrome Tower. Here you'll perfect the ancient art of icing, dicing and shuriken-slicing. And you'll get the chance to wipe the smirks off the faces of all-new creepshow freaks like Roadkill Rodney, Shell Shocker and that nasty villain Filet O'Filth. So get back into your shell and start snapping away, before April goes from delivering the news to singing the blues in some new cement shoes.","total_rating":69.3911439114391,"total_rating_count":6,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-fall-of-the-foot-clan"},{"id":135909,"cover":{"id":110995,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":135909,"height":800,"image_id":"co2dn7","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dn7.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"6e2e139e-8ecf-ef5f-69b9-83530daa6c4c"},"first_release_date":783648000,"genres":[{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":104271,"company":{"id":864,"logo":{"id":151,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":44,"image_id":"s8fufvd2iyb27dl9orps","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s8fufvd2iyb27dl9orps.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"a6e09d2e-cecb-0a7b-60c9-bef8fba2b889"},"name":"Hudson Soft","slug":"hudson-soft"}}],"name":"Bomberman GB2","platforms":[33],"release_dates":[{"id":204717,"category":0,"created_at":1595203200,"date":783648000,"game":135909,"human":"Nov 01, 1994","m":11,"platform":33,"region":8,"updated_at":1595203200,"y":1994,"checksum":"b45d7984-d79e-19ef-edd8-cc80026a8c95"}],"slug":"bomberman-gb2","summary":"A Bomberman named Indy Bomber sets out on a long journey to uncover a legendary treasure called the Ring of Wishes.

The objective of the game is to fight off the members of the Scorpions and confront the true culprit, a rival martial artist named Anderson. A second player can now join in anytime via the use of a Game Link Cable, taking control of Billy's brother, Jimmy. \n \nThe combat system is simpler compared to previous Double Dragon games, including the first Game Boy game. The player can perform a series of punches or a kick on most enemies, followed by straight punch or a high kick that knocks the enemy to the floor. Pressing the A and B buttons simultaneously will cause the player to kneel. While kneeling, pressing either button will cause the player to perform an aerial uppercut. Instead of the hair grab from previous games, the player will do a collar grab (similar to Renegade), in which the player can repeatedly punch his opponent in the face or push them to the ground. While standing near a fallen enemy, a jumping knee drop can be performed. Despite the presence of armed enemies, the player cannot disarm them and pick up their weapons like in other games in the series. \n \nThe game is composed of three missions, spread across ten stages. The first two missions each consist of four stages that follows a basic structure: the player fight their way through a street until reaching the boss. This is followed by a subway platform, a fight inside a subway car, and the destination platform, where the player confronts another boss. The final mission, composed of only two stages, starts at the streets again, but this time the player must fight his way to the entrance of the Scorpions headquarters. Once inside the building, the player fight their way through a series of floors, including an area where all the previous bosses appear, until reaching the top floor where Anderson awaits. The game has three difficulty settings, but the Easy setting only allows the first mission to be played.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/double-dragon-ii-game-boy"},{"id":49049,"first_release_date":728524800,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"name":"Franky, Joe & Dirk...

Using the Dark Lord's powerful magic, his evil minions spread famine, plague, and pestilence wherever they went, leaving the peaceful population hopelessly oppressed. All who challenged the wicked Lord were mercilessly slain as a warning to all those who had any further thoughts of rebellion. Then one day while meditating, the great Shogun, Tokugawa, had a divine vision where he saw a small group of mighty warriors rise up to defeat the evil Lord. He immediately set out to recruit the five bravest and most skillful fighters in the land. After months of searching he was finally ready to put his dream into action.

You are chased by robots (cyborgs) that end your character's life if they catch him, though you can stand on their heads. Your main weapon is the ability to dig both to the left and right of your character. The holes you dig are only temporary and fill themselves in. A robot that falls into one of your holes will be destroyed if the hole fills in before it can escape. Your character can also suffer this same fate, ending his life. Destroyed robots are replaced with new ones that appear from the top of the screen. The robots can also carry gold which they drop if they fall into a hole. The robot's movements are dependent on yours, and a significant facet of the game play is figuring out how to use the robot's movements to your advantage in clearing a stage. Besides bricks and ladders, levels also consist of blocks (which can't be dug into), rope (to traverse platform chasms) and crumbling bricks (which you fall through). Once all gold has been retrieved a missing segment of ladder will appear allowing your character to escape to the next level. Some levels contain keys and doors which provide an alternate way to leave a level.","total_rating":61,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hyper-lode-runner"},{"id":49043,"cover":{"id":111069,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":49043,"height":800,"image_id":"co2dp9","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dp9.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"25da6327-4a6d-b654-804a-b4e8ca37fbba"},"first_release_date":696902400,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":65138,"company":{"id":697,"name":"Ubisoft Bucharest","slug":"ubisoft-bucharest"}},{"id":65139,"company":{"id":7041,"description":"Ubisoft Entertainment SA is a French video game company headquartered in Montreuil.

Gameplay alternated between a story chapter where the player walked around the map and talked to other characters, followed by a platform level, and a boss room. In arcade mode, the player chose a character, and the non-combat parts of the game are skipped. \n \nIn both modes, the game was complete after five stages, most of which were rather short. The boss rooms sometimes started with a scene with Tuxedo Mask where the player would receive an extra life for picking up the rose item. Other items the player could pick up included hearts, which refilled some health, cake slices, which refilled more health, and a tiara, which offered a power-up to the character's attacks.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bishoujo-senshi-sailor-moon-r"},{"id":118546,"cover":{"id":74343,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":118546,"height":384,"image_id":"co1ld3","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ld3.jpg","width":329,"checksum":"773b4334-40f7-79eb-3899-50d625f2d8eb"},"first_release_date":653875200,"genres":[{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":78974,"company":{"id":1766,"name":"Pack-In-Video","slug":"pack-in-video"}}],"name":"Lunar Lander","platforms":[33],"release_dates":[{"id":169663,"category":0,"created_at":1557964800,"date":653875200,"game":118546,"human":"Sep 21, 1990","m":9,"platform":33,"region":8,"updated_at":1557964800,"y":1990,"checksum":"3d21bc46-945f-d5b9-45cb-d0c4cfc8db51"}],"screenshots":[{"id":306221,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":118546,"height":144,"image_id":"sc6ka5","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ka5.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"033c0e5c-7d11-dba3-55ad-b878b8c00481"},{"id":306222,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":118546,"height":144,"image_id":"sc6ka6","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ka6.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"460ff3bf-3f90-e8d3-76e1-377552ee1481"}],"slug":"lunar-lander--3","summary":"Lunar Lander is a space exploration game based around Lift-off, Landing and Exploration \n \nAfter you have landed and explored all eight areas, your mission is completed and you proceed to the next one, which is more of the same.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/lunar-lander--3"},{"id":2837,"collection":{"id":4272,"created_at":1512691200,"games":[2656,2740,2826,2827,2828,2829,2830,2831,2832,2833,2834,2835,2836,2837,2838,2839,2840,2841,2842,2843,2844,2845,39415,68127,78556],"name":"The Simpsons","slug":"the-simpsons","updated_at":1512691200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/the-simpsons","checksum":"4d6a9227-432a-d316-f92f-2b5bdd07809f"},"cover":{"id":111072,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":2837,"height":800,"image_id":"co2dpc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dpc.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"fc911bd3-5623-6d65-da1a-52113cad2013"},"first_release_date":760060800,"franchises":[{"id":89,"created_at":1374364800,"games":[2656,2740,2826,2827,2828,2829,2830,2831,2832,2833,2834,2835,2836,2837,2838,2839,2840,2841,2842,2843,2844,2845],"name":"Simpsons","slug":"simpsons","updated_at":1374364800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/simpsons","checksum":"8436e470-a597-1da4-d690-75179fbb02a4"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":6832,"company":{"id":287,"logo":{"id":447,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":249,"image_id":"qfyuxpskaackdzgnneal","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qfyuxpskaackdzgnneal.jpg","width":767,"checksum":"110da6d6-cd7d-3338-becb-404a5e482d27"},"name":"Acclaim Entertainment","slug":"acclaim-entertainment"}},{"id":6833,"company":{"id":1201,"name":"Software Creations","slug":"software-creations"}}],"name":"The Simpsons: Bart & the Beanstalk","platforms":[33],"rating":60,"rating_count":0,"release_dates":[{"id":6061,"category":1,"created_at":1375142400,"date":760060800,"game":2837,"human":"Feb 1994","m":2,"platform":33,"region":8,"updated_at":1375142400,"y":1994,"checksum":"6184c11b-67e5-f527-11c6-390c78829faa"}],"slug":"the-simpsons-bart-the-beanstalk","summary":"Once upon a time...

Two fighters in serpentine robotic machines try to box each other in to win the fight. The serpents are detailed in the fact that they aren't just a line, giving a greater sense of realism to the game. Each snake has a fixed amount of lives; with losing a life being a representation of \"losing the war.\" The \"game over\" message is a simple message saying \"the bitter taste of defeat\" with an animated picture of a snake crying and accompanied by a melancholic music in a waltz rhythm. \n \nThere are two modes with four difficulty levels; level 1 is considered to be the easiest (normal speed and enemy performance) while level 4 is the hardest (fast speed and enemies are likely to cheat death). The first mode allows players to simply compete against an opponent while the second mode brings in a series of small snakes that emerge when players take too long conquering a level. Missiles can be launched when the player collects them on the field. White numbers help the player develop a longer body while black numbers make the body shorter. \n \nMissiles can either make the enemy faster (black missiles) or slower (white missiles). Winning 7 of the 13 possible matches automatically makes the player into the \"champion of serpents.\"","total_rating":35,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/serpent"},{"id":49000,"first_release_date":878342400,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":78590,"company":{"id":303,"name":"Jaleco","slug":"jaleco"}}],"name":"The Fidgetts","platforms":[33],"rating":50,"rating_count":0,"release_dates":[{"id":95540,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":878342400,"game":49000,"human":"Nov 01, 1997","m":11,"platform":33,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1997,"checksum":"97fe3924-6530-7fe7-0f23-ba3d030cc838"}],"slug":"the-fidgetts","summary":"The Fidgetts is a Puzzle game, developed by Game Over and published by Elite, which was released in Europe in 1993.","total_rating":50,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-fidgetts"},{"id":49093,"cover":{"id":37944,"game":49093,"height":482,"image_id":"awew8pfeuffmg6dbtwnu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/awew8pfeuffmg6dbtwnu.jpg","width":392,"checksum":"1a139b59-b6d1-6efc-c12f-128f8f5676c1"},"first_release_date":744768000,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"name":"Momotaro Thunderbolt","platforms":[33],"release_dates":[{"id":95643,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":747446400,"game":49093,"human":"Sep 08, 1993","m":9,"platform":33,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1993,"checksum":"629a0126-6110-0204-2a5d-5e6583a9f171"},{"id":122643,"category":0,"created_at":1508112000,"date":744768000,"game":49093,"human":"Aug 08, 1993","m":8,"platform":33,"region":5,"updated_at":1508112000,"y":1993,"checksum":"b924563a-8382-9bc2-24aa-11a438ae6874"}],"slug":"momotaro-thunderbolt","summary":"Momotarou Dengeki: Momotaro Thunderbolt is an platformer, published by Hudson, which was released in Japan in 1993.

video game takes places during a hypothetical apocalyptic battle between a dark, evil army and a light, good army. Even the king and queen of each respective kingdom is expected to contribute to combat duty; which was expected of kings in the Middle Ages but not of most queens. \n \nEven though this game is medieval in nature, it does not depict any culture of Medieval Europe against each other. Players can take either side and both kingdom's units are of equal strength to each other. The units in the game correspond to Western high fantasy (i.e., paladins instead of samurai). All fighting is done in an arcade manner (real-time with button mashing) rather than a typical manner of a strategy or role-playing game (either turn-based or real-time without button mashing). \n \nEach player must either destroy all of the opponent's units or capture all the castles in order to win the game and to defeat his or her opponent. Winning results in a celebration screen while losing is the equivalent to a game over.","total_rating":60,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kingdom-crusade"},{"id":49143,"collection":{"id":3339,"created_at":1507334400,"games":[15897,39542,49143,63369,63370,63371,63372,67612],"name":"Oni","slug":"oni","updated_at":1507334400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/oni","checksum":"573741ac-b2f6-5aa7-7d9f-392520c486bc"},"cover":{"id":33644,"game":49143,"height":384,"image_id":"il3fb2r12mznisbwgnni","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/il3fb2r12mznisbwgnni.jpg","width":329,"checksum":"5f637216-83e3-bbef-10b3-aded27b40d11"},"first_release_date":663292800,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"name":"Kininkou Maroku Oni","platforms":[33],"release_dates":[{"id":95647,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":663292800,"game":49143,"human":"Jan 08, 1991","m":1,"platform":33,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1991,"checksum":"c2c2a947-e863-c0f4-d058-97d0b9a092ab"}],"slug":"kininkou-maroku-oni","summary":"Kininkou Maroku Oni is a Role-Playing game, developed by WinkySoft and published by Banpresto, which was released in Japan in 1990.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kininkou-maroku-oni"},{"id":106314,"involved_companies":[{"id":68322,"company":{"id":1126,"name":"Sachen","slug":"sachen"}}],"name":"4-in-1 Version 2","platforms":[33],"release_dates":[{"id":156386,"category":7,"created_at":1532908800,"game":106314,"human":"TBD","platform":33,"region":8,"updated_at":1532908800,"checksum":"f4ea1c42-377a-b443-52f9-c2fc4719ed23"}],"slug":"4-in-1-version-2","summary":"4 -in 1 Volume 2 was the second volume of 4-in-1 multicarts made by Sachen.

He theorizes that among the hatched Aliens there was a queen that laid additional eggs, which would explain the huge number of Aliens. The last survivor sets out to destroy the queen and regain the honor of his clan. \n \nThe Predator must traverse several side-scrolling levels on his way to the queen, while destroying Aliens in all their forms - facehuggers hatched from eggs, chestburster aliens and fully grown warriors. Various weapons are available: the standard weapon are the wrist blades. Ammunition for the shoulder cannon, the cutting disks and bombs must be picked up. The bombs not only work as weapons but can also be used to destroy barriers. To avoid a fight altogether, the Predator can also use his invisibility system, which runs down the energy supply. To recharge it, energy powerups must be collected. Also hidden in the levels are keys that open up doors blocking the way into the next area. A small radar map helps in navigating the maze-like corridors and also displays approaching enemies.","total_rating":40,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/alien-vs-predator-the-last-of-his-clan"},{"id":48973,"first_release_date":815184000,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":78479,"company":{"id":678,"name":"Black Pearl Software","slug":"black-pearl-software"}}],"name":"Madden 96","platforms":[33],"rating":50,"rating_count":0,"release_dates":[{"id":95517,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":815184000,"game":48973,"human":"Nov 01, 1995","m":11,"platform":33,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1995,"checksum":"0fc31537-1fdc-5bff-4c13-66a0da1a66dc"}],"slug":"madden-96","summary":"All 30 NFL teams, including Jacksonville and Carolina.

The blocks will regenerate after a couple of seconds if you didn’t manage to take them all out at the same time. By pushing and pulling barrels into the correct position - while avoiding enemies - you can force the shockwave from Papuwa’s punch to split off into different directions. By failing to destroy all of the blocks with the first punch, you do actually get the opportunity to collect some items, which can come in handy for boss battles.

It was one of the first Sailor Moon-related video games to be released. \n \nIn this game, the player controlled Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon. The storyline was based on the first, third, and fourth episodes of the first season of the anime. Although they originally had not yet appeared in those episodes, in the game Usagi could meet and talk to Ami and Rei, who were NPCs (non-player characters). \n \nThe three levels were divided into two parts. First, Usagi could walk through the city, school or a health spa, occassionally talking to people. After talking to the right people, Usagi turned into Sailor Moon and entered another kind of level in which she fought numerous enemies. \n \nBy default, Sailor Moon could only use kicking attacks. Pressing the \"down\" button would make Sailor Moon sit down and cry, and if there were rocks on the wall nearby, her high-pitched crying would make the rocks explode and drop special items. These items gave different powers: one enabled her to use Moon Tiara Action for a limited number of times, one made her invincible for a short amount of time, etc. \n \nThe bosses were Morga, Kyurene, Jadeite, and Queen Beryl.

The player can choose to play as any of the six rangers, who will start off each stage as a Ninja Ranger. The Red, Blue, and White Rangers are the stronger characters, while Black, Pink, and Yellow are more agile. By defeating enemies throughout each stage, mainly Putty Patrols, and accumulating enough Thunderbolt items to fill up the power gauge, the player can transform their character into a Power Ranger. Filling up the power gauge again while in Power Ranger mode will allow the player to perform a super attack. The game consists of six stages. The first five stages can be played in any order, while the sixth one can only be played after completing the other five.","total_rating":64,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-the-movie--2"},{"id":51241,"cover":{"id":74359,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":51241,"height":808,"image_id":"co1ldj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ldj.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"82171b38-0f84-c15d-dba3-824d812f8247"},"first_release_date":694137600,"name":"Elevator Action","platforms":[33],"release_dates":[{"id":169683,"category":2,"created_at":1557964800,"date":694137600,"game":51241,"human":"1991","m":12,"platform":33,"region":8,"updated_at":1557964800,"y":1991,"checksum":"d835cc59-11dc-34d3-1672-5e17a59d4115"}],"slug":"elevator-action--1","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/elevator-action--1"},{"id":15934,"collection":{"id":1999,"created_at":1452643200,"games":[15934,16141,18067,84640],"name":"Gargoyle's Quest","slug":"gargoyles-quest","updated_at":1452643200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/gargoyles-quest","checksum":"0871f009-de4b-2f2d-5b5e-74f2ec2b35b8"},"cover":{"id":103378,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":15934,"height":800,"image_id":"co27rm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co27rm.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"5766d062-cb32-649e-1b4a-db0d4ff3a5bf"},"first_release_date":641606400,"franchises":[{"id":633,"created_at":1441497600,"games":[12481,15934,18067,22054,43642,63644,84640,89877],"name":"Ghosts 'n Goblins","slug":"ghosts-n-goblins","updated_at":1441497600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/ghosts-n-goblins","checksum":"340d5eaa-fa2b-d90c-53a3-d0cd4af1ec9a"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":99760,"company":{"id":25341,"name":"Capcom Co., LTD.","slug":"capcom-co-dot-ltd"}}],"name":"Gargoyle's Quest","platforms":[33],"rating":72.2680890538033,"rating_count":7,"release_dates":[{"id":43706,"category":0,"created_at":1452643200,"date":641606400,"game":15934,"human":"May 02, 1990","m":5,"platform":33,"region":5,"updated_at":1452643200,"y":1990,"checksum":"3a0908f9-bee2-1f3f-091f-2be27c9c8dc2"},{"id":197007,"category":0,"created_at":1590364800,"date":646790400,"game":15934,"human":"Jul 01, 1990","m":7,"platform":33,"region":2,"updated_at":1590364800,"y":1990,"checksum":"397b17ca-6697-d198-ad53-a17ba5194c62"},{"id":197008,"category":0,"created_at":1590364800,"date":662688000,"game":15934,"human":"Jan 01, 1991","m":1,"platform":33,"region":1,"updated_at":1590364800,"y":1991,"checksum":"526b3f47-f40b-c53a-eb19-a2878d824d57"}],"screenshots":[{"id":19624,"game":15934,"height":288,"image_id":"cl9z9uqnjumg2vz536yt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cl9z9uqnjumg2vz536yt.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"18330826-abab-d998-5d6e-4478aa86c527"},{"id":385410,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":15934,"height":576,"image_id":"sc89du","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc89du.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"72acfc88-63d0-851d-bf7f-804049bbf1e2"},{"id":385411,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":15934,"height":360,"image_id":"sc89dv","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc89dv.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"fbb0880a-1d7e-3a7a-0b23-628e3bc0a0d3"}],"slug":"gargoyles-quest","summary":"Gargoyle's Quest Brings Big-Screen Action to Game Boy! \n \nYou are Firebrand - gargoyle and proud guardian of the Ghoul Realm.

This is his first appearance in a video game. The game was exclusively created for the Swedish market. \n \nBamse is not an original game. Instead it is a re-skinned version of Baby T-Rex by the same developer. This explains why the settings of the game appears out of context with very little to do with the original cartoon. It also suffers from translation errors and contain left overs from the original game which do not fit in. \n \nIt is a very traditional platform game where you run and jump to get to the end of the stage.

While Nintendo did not get the NFL license for this one, it did secure the license of the NFL Player's Association, so the 8 teams to choose from (all named after the appropriate NFL cities) are all stocked up with real pro players from the 1989 season. You can even substitute second-stringers for the \"skill\" positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your starters get tired. \n \nPlay perspective is very unusual: top-down slightly modified with a three-quarters tilt behind the offense, and the scrolling is diagonal, from the bottom left to upper right of the screen. Each team has 12 passing and 12 running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively gives you a total of 48 potential plays to run. The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 blitzes to select from. The kicking and punting games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system. \n \nGames are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters.

Although it was released in 1990 (1991 in Europe), all of the monsters are from the Showa generation. The game is a port of an edition from the MSX console. Also the international version is slightly different from the Japanese version (different in-game character designs and behavior of the enemy characters). \n \nVarious monsters that Godzilla had previously defeated, have kidnapped his son, Minilla, and hidden him somewhere inside the Labyrinth of Matrix. It is up to Godzilla to fight the monsters' attacks and solve their many puzzles, all while navigating a much larger maze. \n \nMonsters- \nGodzilla: The first playable character. He must punch boulders through 64 levels, in order to find his son. \nMinilla: Godzilla's son, who was captured and placed in the heart of the Labyrinth of Matrix. He is only seen in the end, and does not appear in any of the levels. \nBaragon: A slow moving enemy. \nMechagodzilla: One of Godzilla's main rivals, with a speed that is slightly slower than Godzilla's. \nHedorah: A normally invincible monster, that can only be defeated by a boulder, a spike pit, or a lightning bolt. He is also the slowest in movement. \nAnguirus: A mutant ankylosaurus that is usually an ally of Godzilla. Normally is a regular paced enemy, but once he is leveled with Godzilla, he will charge at a high speed, making him the fastest in the game. \nRodan: A mutant pterosaur that, just like Anguirus, is usually Godzilla's ally, but now an enemy who flies after him, making it harder to avoid damage. \nGhidorah: A mutant space dragon. After about two minutes, Ghidorah will appear. Having both invincibility and flight, it is very hard to make it past him. He can't be killed by anything. Ghidorah also flies in short bursts.","total_rating":57,"total_rating_count":3,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/godzilla--1"},{"id":1713,"cover":{"id":89085,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":1713,"height":800,"image_id":"co1wql","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1wql.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"66e1810b-2e15-d871-57f8-ba2bccf8520f"},"first_release_date":934243200,"franchises":[{"id":24,"created_at":1339286400,"games":[22141,22146],"name":"Mario Bros.","slug":"mario-bros","updated_at":1339286400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/mario-bros","checksum":"eb489cba-bbc3-e320-81d8-fe484c890e22"},{"id":799,"created_at":1460764800,"games":[1713,3451,3452,18786,20388,20612,26760,27255,27285,39663,80368,85843,103368],"name":"Bomberman","slug":"bomberman","updated_at":1460764800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/bomberman","checksum":"11e88cde-e789-9ebf-0759-8705f3551800"},{"id":1752,"created_at":1584662400,"games":[1072,1696,1697,1698,1699,1700,1701,1702,1703,1704,1705,1706,1707,1708,1709,1710,1711,1712,1713,50705,70765,85325,90108],"name":"Wario","slug":"wario","updated_at":1584662400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/wario","checksum":"021bcefb-a535-68a8-c758-d6c60651326b"}],"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":3400,"company":{"id":864,"logo":{"id":151,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":44,"image_id":"s8fufvd2iyb27dl9orps","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s8fufvd2iyb27dl9orps.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"a6e09d2e-cecb-0a7b-60c9-bef8fba2b889"},"name":"Hudson Soft","slug":"hudson-soft"}},{"id":3401,"company":{"id":70,"description":"Nintendo Co., Ltd. is a multinational corporation located in Kyoto, Japan.

Each wrestler has his unique special move along with punch, clothesline, bodyslam, suplex, dropkick, and cross body block. One can choose between a single match and an elimination match which runs the gauntlet of the remaining wrestlers. \nThrowing one's opponent out of the ring is possible, as is fighting outside of the ring. There is no ten-count while both wrestlers are outside of the ring, but one will start after one enters. \n[edit]Wrestlers \n \nThese wrestlers used in the game were considered to be the top-ranked superstars of the WCW as of 1993. They were Rick Rude, Ron Simmons, Steve Austin, Sting, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, Big Van Vader and former tag team duo The Steiner Brothers (who had left for the WWF but still appeared in the game anyway).","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wcw-the-main-event"},{"id":18630,"collection":{"id":311,"created_at":1349568000,"games":[1476,1477,1478,1479,1480,1481,1482,1483,1484,1485,1486,1487,1488,1489,18192,18630,39999,48646,48996,83284,98976],"name":"Gradius","slug":"gradius","updated_at":1349568000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/gradius","checksum":"9b466beb-bfa2-6c18-5918-eb0d684db4c7"},"cover":{"id":100881,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":18630,"height":755,"image_id":"co25u9","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co25u9.jpg","width":567,"checksum":"5634a0fb-a26f-1f21-949a-b01018f9af61"},"first_release_date":635731200,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":32,"created_at":1341360000,"name":"Indie","slug":"indie","updated_at":1341360000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/indie","checksum":"2522259f-2454-ec02-5dc0-84373e0508ed"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":34392,"company":{"id":129,"description":"Konami Holdings Corporation, commonly referred to as Konami, is a Japanese entertainment and gaming conglomerate.

Pro-Am is a racing video game that is similar to its predecessor, R.C. Pro-Am, for the NES. In the game, players race remote control cars on a series of tracks. It can be played solo, with two-players via the Game Link Cable, or with three or four players via the Four Player Adapter. The game features 24 different tracks of increasing difficulty, and the object is to finish in the top three in order to qualify to race in the next track. Players who do not finish in the top three may use a continue and retry the track; players get three continues, and the game ends when the player fails to finish in the top three and has no continues remaining. \nEach track is different and range from standard ovals to tracks with many twists and turns. The game includes many obstacles, such as oil slicks that send players spinning, puddles of water that cause players to slide out of control, sand traps and \"slow cones\" that slow players down, large cones that bring players to a complete halt, and walls of tires that players bounce off. If a player hits an oil slick and then hits a wall while spinning, the player's car is temporarily destroyed, which loses time. The tracks also has items that help players along the way: \"zippers\" (a series of chevrons on the track) give players a speed boost, roll cages allow players to hit walls without being destroyed and allow them to crash opponents by forcing them into walls, and missiles and bombs temporarily destroy opponents' cars. Also on the track are spare parts which help improve performance—tires improve traction, batteries increase acceleration, and engines improve speed. \nPlayers have the opportunity to upgrade their vehicles by collecting letters, which are distributed throughout the tracks. By spelling \"Nintendo\" with the letters, players upgrade to a better vehicle; players can upgrade from the \"Racer\" to the \"Speed demon\" and then to the Spiker, each of which performs progressively better than the previous vehicle. If players spell \"Nintendo\" while racing with the Spiker, then they win the game.","total_rating":82,"total_rating_count":3,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-rc-pro-am"},{"id":49035,"cover":{"id":54817,"game":49035,"height":181,"image_id":"eintdhdnqde5tlv3i5dq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eintdhdnqde5tlv3i5dq.jpg","width":181,"checksum":"96d4a43c-855d-d968-aa8b-4a1bbe757f1a"},"first_release_date":704678400,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":78499,"company":{"id":2678,"logo":{"id":113,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":116,"image_id":"k3mfyob5xw6gsw8lgpfq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k3mfyob5xw6gsw8lgpfq.jpg","width":350,"checksum":"9f23de12-17da-7883-c6a9-33db09b37c6f"},"name":"Data East","slug":"data-east"}}],"name":"Nail 'N Scale","platforms":[33],"rating":40,"rating_count":0,"release_dates":[{"id":95557,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":704678400,"game":49035,"human":"May 01, 1992","m":5,"platform":33,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1992,"checksum":"429ff4c2-3d07-8c72-09dd-bd3404951828"}],"slug":"nail-n-scale","summary":"Nail 'N Scale is an Action game, developed and published by I'Max, which was released in 1992.","total_rating":40,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nail-n-scale"},{"id":48949,"collection":{"id":4875,"created_at":1512864000,"games":[48948,48949],"name":"Dr. Franken","slug":"dr-franken","updated_at":1512864000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/dr-franken","checksum":"917d5ebf-b54c-7811-8144-a8e8d27f9981"},"cover":{"id":111280,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":48949,"height":800,"image_id":"co2dv4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dv4.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"6b6fc827-e406-4881-3e3e-d1acb30018ae"},"first_release_date":728438400,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"name":"Dr. Franken","platforms":[33],"rating":61,"rating_count":1,"release_dates":[{"id":95496,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":728438400,"game":48949,"human":"Jan 31, 1993","m":1,"platform":33,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1993,"checksum":"7e66c3a7-85ae-bd75-fa1d-d1a48b25f2cf"}],"screenshots":[{"id":157121,"game":48949,"height":144,"image_id":"jbwxc1fa0rykbqrwhhb9","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jbwxc1fa0rykbqrwhhb9.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"a49c73d5-74ae-6cbf-19d8-4b4bfcf405b3"},{"id":157122,"game":48949,"height":144,"image_id":"c0ajaz5iuhmirpwbuzvj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c0ajaz5iuhmirpwbuzvj.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"bf988d01-fbee-f7d2-4c60-c983745747e0"},{"id":157123,"game":48949,"height":144,"image_id":"vmbrj40kxiw5brkiukab","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vmbrj40kxiw5brkiukab.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"33492bb9-ce65-d575-d0c2-534a10ef21f0"},{"id":157124,"game":48949,"height":144,"image_id":"itjjrn1iufensmwhcpar","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/itjjrn1iufensmwhcpar.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"6768c891-fdee-3cb6-1e50-7e56f5b6dd5e"},{"id":157125,"game":48949,"height":144,"image_id":"sd2he8jxkuhtplmhoyjo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sd2he8jxkuhtplmhoyjo.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"c696d2c7-ec17-5195-465c-9e7cdfa64fae"},{"id":157126,"game":48949,"height":144,"image_id":"ercpk7ildojhykhzmtsf","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ercpk7ildojhykhzmtsf.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"30ebac52-ef58-ca88-3f12-5aa026c7c3a8"},{"id":157127,"game":48949,"height":144,"image_id":"xxdgjvfoqci85fuyzxw4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xxdgjvfoqci85fuyzxw4.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"7f35c817-dee8-62d7-2a4b-e5eec6a8b718"},{"id":157128,"game":48949,"height":144,"image_id":"n1xbqvlfi6lyblumypqf","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n1xbqvlfi6lyblumypqf.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"30e1a0d7-5d2f-706f-518c-7fc3ad842f91"},{"id":157129,"game":48949,"height":144,"image_id":"th91qicwzawxn0f45mmh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/th91qicwzawxn0f45mmh.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"3a5ce552-e2b5-12d3-731c-8078d0918d09"},{"id":157130,"game":48949,"height":144,"image_id":"ak3ksadtju9xdgtovglx","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ak3ksadtju9xdgtovglx.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"35c59b3c-9c7b-9625-e4e1-49faf0027525"}],"slug":"dr-franken","summary":"The Game Boy release of the game uses a password-based saving system to save the player's progress.

The damsel in distress has been imprisoned by the Antagonistic Alchemist within the highest tower of the Royal Castle on the planet Blobolinia. Like its predecessor, A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia, The Rescue of Princess Blobette is a puzzle-platformer in which the player directly controls the boy as he is followed around by the blob, who is controlled by the computer AI. The pair must navigate the various passages and floors of the castle to locate and free Blobette. The boy can only run back and forth, cannot jump or swim, and will die if he falls a long distance or comes in contact with dangerous objects such as flame throwers and sewer serpents. However, the blob can be made to turn into useful tools when he is fed jelly beans of various flavors. Each flavor causes a different transformation. For example, feeding the blob a tangerine jelly bean will change him into a trampoline, which the boy can then use to reach high platforms. The player may also locate extra jelly bean sacks and numerous, optional treasures. Finding five peppermints will increase the player's extra lives by one.","total_rating":42,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/david-cranes-the-rescue-of-princess-blobette"},{"id":48924,"collection":{"id":545,"created_at":1381017600,"games":[2970,7776,14591,18577,18627,48924,103289],"name":"Battletoads","slug":"battletoads","updated_at":1381017600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/battletoads","checksum":"123fb641-7368-8bb2-f565-46af1555faa6"},"cover":{"id":52196,"game":48924,"height":299,"image_id":"hrmk7rk9lbo7exzdeutz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hrmk7rk9lbo7exzdeutz.jpg","width":302,"checksum":"7840f964-3311-b5d0-9f9b-51bf602e10af"},"first_release_date":741484800,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"},{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"}],"name":"Battletoads in Ragnarok's World","platforms":[33],"rating":71,"rating_count":0,"release_dates":[{"id":95465,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":741484800,"game":48924,"human":"Jul 01, 1993","m":7,"platform":33,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1993,"checksum":"a54f31fe-6c84-feef-17c9-b7ea281bb0d3"}],"slug":"battletoads-in-ragnaroks-world","summary":"Okay 'toads!

You maneuver the cook up and down ladders and left and right across floors in order to walk across various parts of giant hamburgers, such as large lettuce, big buns and massive meat patties. After you cross any section of any hamburger, it will drop one level and push any other burger part within that stack down a floor as well. The object of the game is to build all the hamburgers in each stage by dropping all the makings of each burger into completed stacks at the bottom of the screen. \n \nAs you go about your burger building business, Food Foes Mr. Pickle, Mr. Egg and Mr. Hot dog (also known as Frank N. Furter) will chase after you. You can destroy these culinary cutups by trapping them in falling burger parts or by tricking them into walking on a burger part you are in the process of dropping. To freeze the Food Foes, you can sprinkle a dash of pepper on them. You begin the game with a small pepper supply and can pick up additional pepper shakers that appear throughout the levels. You can also pick up bonus points (in the guise of cups and saucers) and extra lives. \n \nUnlike the original BurgerTime, which had less than 10 different non-scrolling screens, BurgerTime Deluxe has seven levels with four stages in each level for a grand total of 28 screens, most of which scroll to some degree. A password feature enables you to return to the beginning of last level you played.

Each level is timed, and once the timer is started it cannot be stopped until the level is finished. One starts off the game with only three pentomino pieces, and at the completion of each early level, a new piece is awarded to the player. At the final level, the player is given the 2x2 square O tetromino and must complete an 8x8 square puzzle. \n \nAfter completing each level, the player was given a password to access that level at a later time. Interestingly, each password was a common English four-letter word, so that by guessing common four-letter words, players could potentially access levels they had not actually reached by playing the game.","total_rating":65,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/daedalian-opus"}]}
