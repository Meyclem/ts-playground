Those familiar with Taz's character on the Looney Tunes cartoons will recognize the fact that Taz hasn't lost his taste for strange and unusual objects as his food source and continues with that practice in his game. Taz literally has to eat his way through each level in order to advance to the next level.

The more food Taz consumes, the faster he will advance and the closer he will get to rescuing his friend. The road to the rescue will be littered with obstacles and challenges from Taz's enemies.

The player can choose whether they want to focus on the management side of football, play the matches themselves on the game's 2D match engine, or combine the two features for a more in-depth experience. It is endorsed by Irish football manager David O'Leary, who was managing Leeds United A.F.C. at the time of the game's release. \n \nThe management side of O'Leary Manager 2000 is very comprehensive when compared to similar Game Boy Color games. The player can choose from 240 fully licensed teams from the top two leagues in England, France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands to play as or manage, with each team having 16 players in their squad. There is also the option to promote a number of fictional youth team players. However, most of the youth team players are of low ability, so could only realistically be used for back-up when managing a decent quality team. \n \nAs with any football management game, the transfer market can often play a key role in whether the team achieves success. The player's selected team starts with either 10.5m or 5.5m to spend, depending on whether they were in the first or second tier of their country's football hierarchy. The player can also recoup some money by selling players to other teams. This is done by first offering the footballer for sale at a chosen price, from which interested clubs would then place offers that the player could choose to accept or not. Once a price is agreed, the footballer transfers clubs instantly. The values of footballers alternate greatly during the game, with the then Real Betis striker Denílson being the most expensive player at the start of the game. An unfortunate bug in the game allows the player to gain a huge sum of money (around 70m) if the club goes into a certain amount of debt, which pretty much negates the need for financial planning. \n \nThe club's board of directors constantly give assessments as to how they think the club is progressing under your management. This involves a short statement visible at the menu screen. Other features available the menu screen include options to change you team line-up, formation and tactics; all vital when creating a successful team. \n \nSimilarly, you can decide what methods of training your team will undertake for the coming week. You have the option to \"do training\", which generally increase the statistics of your players (but at the risk of injuring them) or to concentrate on fitness training (which helps players stay fit and injured players to recover quicker). Alternatively, you may choose to skip training entirely for the week. You also have the option to view various statistics, such as league tables from around the world, top goalscorers and to view the squads of all available teams on the game.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/oleary-manager-2000"},{"id":2840,"collection":{"id":4272,"created_at":1512691200,"games":[2656,2740,2826,2827,2828,2829,2830,2831,2832,2833,2834,2835,2836,2837,2838,2839,2840,2841,2842,2843,2844,2845,39415,68127,78556],"name":"The Simpsons","slug":"the-simpsons","updated_at":1512691200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/the-simpsons","checksum":"4d6a9227-432a-d316-f92f-2b5bdd07809f"},"cover":{"id":2806,"game":2840,"height":256,"image_id":"ut7qatppthvieop98lpo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ut7qatppthvieop98lpo.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"455c79da-f4ac-7f55-a89a-3abd927840da"},"first_release_date":985564800,"franchises":[{"id":89,"created_at":1374364800,"games":[2656,2740,2826,2827,2828,2829,2830,2831,2832,2833,2834,2835,2836,2837,2838,2839,2840,2841,2842,2843,2844,2845],"name":"Simpsons","slug":"simpsons","updated_at":1374364800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/simpsons","checksum":"8436e470-a597-1da4-d690-75179fbb02a4"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":6838,"company":{"id":197,"description":"THQ Inc. is a leading worldwide developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software.

Sometimes the best things come in small packages, and that's certainly the case in this small-scale racing challenge for the Game Boy Color.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/racin-ratz"},{"id":8724,"collection":{"id":1176,"created_at":1421798400,"games":[3051,7814,8012,8723,8724,64507],"name":"Crazy Castle","slug":"crazy-castle","updated_at":1421798400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/crazy-castle","checksum":"415e367c-b64e-f87b-de93-7122df0a82b1"},"cover":{"id":9217,"game":8724,"height":643,"image_id":"odryqrrsvqd7c1bsbemc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/odryqrrsvqd7c1bsbemc.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"a4ada5f4-745e-ffcb-fec5-373f4852237e"},"first_release_date":978220800,"franchises":[{"id":92,"created_at":1374624000,"games":[2719,3044,3045,3051,3052,3053,3054,3336,3345,3979,4194,4460,4461,4518,4977,5903,7814,8065,8066,8076,8077,8097,8098,8099,8131,8132,8133,8134,8135,8136,8137,8723,8724,25800,46096,97314],"name":"Looney Tunes","slug":"looney-tunes","updated_at":1374624000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/looney-tunes","checksum":"25d2955d-2626-394c-9ff0-afde358c1e61"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":21526,"company":{"id":1281,"description":"Kotobuki Solution Co., Ltd.","logo":{"id":1699,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":189,"image_id":"escxtt0uc03ytcrn5q38","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/escxtt0uc03ytcrn5q38.jpg","width":454,"checksum":"d1808292-8e4a-5466-cc86-ce02d64fce8c"},"name":"Kemco","slug":"kemco"}}],"name":"Bugs Bunny in Crazy Castle 4","platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"id":179112,"category":2,"created_at":1573171200,"date":978220800,"game":8724,"human":"2000","m":12,"platform":22,"region":8,"updated_at":1573171200,"y":2000,"checksum":"0ce8d1d7-3fe7-1641-c818-1e70dc83d8d5"}],"screenshots":[{"id":8409,"game":8724,"height":144,"image_id":"zu1mwszxppsdvgi5or2h","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zu1mwszxppsdvgi5or2h.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"f9dde165-13c1-a80b-4a70-f099bcb5d1cf"}],"slug":"bugs-bunny-in-crazy-castle-4","summary":"Bugs Bunny returns in BUGS BUNNYS CRAZY CASTLE 4 for Game Boy Color!

But first you need to clear the skies of a ton of fast-moving, falling balloons. Guide Yogi across the bottom of the screen, sending balloons shooting upwards from your special picnic basket.

Much to Pooh and Tigger's collective dismay, the area is populated by dozens of insects, angry animals, and environmental dangers. In addition to searching for the hunny, you'll have to help your pals find such popular characters as Rabbit, Piglet, and Owl, as well as unlocking dozens of hidden areas and special power-ups.

Beauty and the Beast: A Board Game Adventure is a game for the Game Boy Color. There are two modes of play. In the first you play on a big game board, where each square represents a Disney character. When you land on a square you play a mini-game against or inspired by him or her. For instance if you land on the square showing the inventor father you will have to play a game where his new log chopping device cuts firewood and he has to bounce it across the screen on a spring.

People prayed to God for help, and God created new life forms. However, new life forms brought new troubles, so God became exasperated and sealed them in \"disc stones\". Many years have passed since then and God entrusted the humans with the secret of \"disc stones\". Today people still continue searching for these missing \"disc stones\" to unlock the lifeforms within. In the anime, the monsters were created by scientists. \n \nIt is said that one monster is trapped inside each one. One day a group of workers excavating the ancient ruins happened to dig up one of these mythical disc stones. The worker who first discovered a disc stone took the disc to the Monsters' Temple. There the priests, using the ancient methods, unlocked the monster inside the disc stone. In a place where ranchers and monsters coexisted peacefully, the battle of the monsters began. As time passed these monster battles became extremely popular, and monster breeding became the standard pastime of the land. Eventually disc stones were found around the entire world.

Many of the items that you collect throughout the adventure can be traded for others via friends playing the other POWERPUFF GIRLS games on their systems.

In 1999, HotGen Studios, Ltd., a company in the United Kingdom, was selected by Capcom to port the game. \n \nThis should not be confused with Resident Evil Gaiden or the later and much more superior port, Resident Evil: Deadly Silence. \n \nThe Game Boy Color game is a direct-conversion of the PlayStation game, down to camera angles, story, and enemy\\item placement. The difference is the sprite scaling for characters and enemies to move on a psuedo-3D plane with static backgrounds. New features planned for this was a greater variety of enemies and the ability to disarm traps. A new save feature was also in development, negating Ink Ribbons and Typewriters. \n \nThe game was 90% complete when, upon evaluation from Capcom, was canceled with the official statement being they were \"not confident that the product would have made both consumers and Capcom happy.\" \n \n2 cartridge ROM dumps were recovered and leaked online in 2012 following a $2000 fundraiser. \n \nThe game is still buggy and unfinished. E.g., there's no ending screen, doors won't say they're locked or what key you need, all weapons have infinite ammo, and zombies are forced into invisible \"zones\" to make sure very few sprites were on screen at the same time.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-game-boy-color"},{"id":49874,"cover":{"id":85761,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":49874,"height":1576,"image_id":"co1u69","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1u69.jpg","width":1182,"checksum":"ae3f8084-9640-a1a5-18d3-9f844db865b4"},"first_release_date":964396800,"genres":[{"id":11,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","slug":"real-time-strategy-rts","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/real-time-strategy-rts","checksum":"aaa36cbc-2258-8653-a461-1358df8ce445"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":87740,"company":{"id":1330,"logo":{"id":1070,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":150,"image_id":"yzpbwmysmxevfhi3uiab","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yzpbwmysmxevfhi3uiab.jpg","width":200,"checksum":"49c3eb18-69bc-1578-92c9-0311835fdeba"},"name":"Bits Studios","slug":"bits-studios"}},{"id":95387,"company":{"id":70,"description":"Nintendo Co., Ltd. is a multinational corporation located in Kyoto, Japan.

Upon receiving this letter, they realized the golden statue belongs to the place from which the letter was sent.

Although it shares its title with the first entry in the series, Tomb Raider for Game Boy Color follows a different storyline.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tomb-raider--1"},{"id":49856,"cover":{"id":56144,"game":49856,"height":657,"image_id":"l5xlrbtih2wdreeoqxyx","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/l5xlrbtih2wdreeoqxyx.jpg","width":519,"checksum":"6a134359-ad7b-c796-77e0-6a8392a0d0e2"},"first_release_date":1027987200,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"},{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":16,"created_at":1297641600,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","slug":"turn-based-strategy-tbs","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/turn-based-strategy-tbs","checksum":"af5d3ecd-2ebd-358b-70df-e9204b9761be"}],"name":"Dragon Ball Z: Legendary Super Warriors","platforms":[22],"rating":70.0427359310212,"rating_count":5,"release_dates":[{"id":96389,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":1027987200,"game":49856,"human":"Jul 30, 2002","m":7,"platform":22,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":2002,"checksum":"10029f69-5ad0-02d7-c586-fbce37397b70"}],"slug":"dragon-ball-z-legendary-super-warriors","summary":"Dragon Ball Z: Legendary Super Warriors is a mixture of a card game and a turn-based fighting game for the Game Boy Color.

As each turn of the battle starts, players decide which direction a Metal Walker will move and how hard they will move. Players are encouraged to form strategies that allow Metal Walkers to hit a single enemy, bounce off a wall, and then hit another enemy, all in a single turn. On the battlefield, players can throw several different types of items onto the field. The items are used when a Metal Walker hits them. Capsules and healing items strengthen and heal Metal Walkers, whereas attack items, such as Napalm, are only useful when the enemy hits them. There also exist Analyzers, which provide the player with Scan Data for any Metal Walker that is bounced into them. Scrap metal won after the battle can then be used with the Scan Data to create new Metal Walkers or purchase items. When an enemy is destroyed, the player's Metal Walker will gain experience points and an item might be obtained. If the player's Metal Walker runs out of Hit points, the player will lose half of the carried scraps and have to start from the last save point. \n \nOutside of battle, players explore a top-down overworld where they can explore various towns and dungeons. Most battles occur as random encounters. The overworld has several interactable elements, such as water, which the player needs a certain number of Cores to cross. The player can only carry one Metal Walker at a time and it will follow the main character on the overworld. By defeating the game's bosses, players earn Core Units, which allow Metal Walkers to evolve into new, stronger forms.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/metal-walker"},{"id":49880,"collection":{"id":4708,"created_at":1512777600,"games":[3436,49880],"name":"All Star Tennis","slug":"all-star-tennis","updated_at":1512777600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/all-star-tennis","checksum":"988251c3-189a-1315-fc9e-516b5f606af6"},"cover":{"id":49490,"game":49880,"height":650,"image_id":"hl3bjffepriwaexxe3pf","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hl3bjffepriwaexxe3pf.jpg","width":645,"checksum":"344747d2-dc35-d12d-95a9-84e729c55ed4"},"first_release_date":932860800,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"All Star Tennis 2000","platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"id":96404,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":932860800,"game":49880,"human":"Jul 25, 1999","m":7,"platform":22,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1999,"checksum":"2ce42eef-23db-defb-48c0-2c2505460ca3"}],"slug":"all-star-tennis-2000","summary":"This is a cartoon style tennis challenge that requires all your skill!

Each table has its own details and gameplay elements. \n \nEach table has different \"locations\" that you play, which determine which Pokémon are available for capture. A subset of available locations are displayed slot-machine style in the beginning of a game, and pressing A will select your starting location and launch the first ball into play. After that, each table has its own mechanism for advancing to the next location, including the locations not available at the start of the game. \n \n\"Catch Mode,\" when activated, starts a 2 minute window of opportunity where you can attempt to capture a Pokémon. Once you activate \"catch mode,\" you must hit the pop bumpers 6 times. Each hit unlocks 1/6 of an image of the Pokémon currently up for capture. Once the image is complete, the Pokémon appears on the table, where it must be hit 4 times with the ball to capture it. \n \n\"Evolution Mode,\" when activated, starts a 2 minute window of opportunity where you select a captured Pokémon (from the current game in progress only) and attempt to evolve it into another form. This is the only way to add the evolved form to your Pokédex. Once you select a Pokémon, you must hit targets on the playfield. There are up to 6 targets, but only 3 of them have items in them you need to evolve a Pokémon. The others create a time-wasting sequence before you can hit targets again. If you hit a target with an item, the item appears on the playfield and must be collected with the ball. Once you've collected 3 items, the hole in the center of the board opens up. Sinking the ball in the hole successfully evolves the Pokémon.","total_rating":63.1634075611388,"total_rating_count":54,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-pinball"},{"id":134275,"collection":{"id":6244,"created_at":1590624000,"games":[3602,134275],"name":"Space Station Silicon Valley","slug":"space-station-silicon-valley","updated_at":1590624000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/space-station-silicon-valley","checksum":"8ad9170f-9db9-e89f-c287-63d7d10c0459"},"cover":{"id":103940,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":134275,"height":474,"image_id":"co2878","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2878.jpg","width":354,"checksum":"e50ac8c9-ba9a-3494-b056-3303d54cb5c1"},"first_release_date":946512000,"franchises":[{"id":1868,"created_at":1590624000,"games":[3602,134275],"name":"Space Station Silicon Valley","slug":"space-station-silicon-valley","updated_at":1590624000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/space-station-silicon-valley","checksum":"e6f46b99-49a8-04b9-fb56-e0faf702a98f"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":100202,"company":{"id":266,"name":"Tarantula Studios","slug":"tarantula-studios"}},{"id":100203,"company":{"id":139,"description":"Headquartered in New York City, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. is a leading developer, marketer and publisher of interactive entertainment for consumers around the globe.

You'll be shown what kind of vehicle the suspect is driving, and then you'll hit the streets to find him.

The Matchbox Emergency Patrol, that's who! Play as a firefighter, police officer, or paramedic in this high-energy challenge based on real-life crises. Whichever hero you choose, you'll receive word of a situation over your radio, hop in your designated vehicle, and navigate your way to the scene of the potential disaster. Of course, there's really no way to know exactly what the scene is going to be when you arrive, so you'd better be on your toes. You might find a robbery in progress, but it might just be two people having an argument, so use your best judgment as to how to handle the situation. Modeled after the Matchbox Emergency Patrol series of die-cast toy vehicles, MATCHBOX EMERGENCY PATROL (the game) is an in-depth adventure revolving around crimes, accidents, and medical emergencies. There are nine different missions for each of the three emergency workers, making it a very diverse game.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/matchbox-emergency-patrol"},{"id":5916,"collection":{"id":3443,"created_at":1507507200,"games":[5915,5916,5918,5920,49391],"name":"Mary-Kate and Ashley","slug":"mary-kate-and-ashley","updated_at":1507507200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/mary-kate-and-ashley","checksum":"69e79c3a-80e9-0e96-99cd-986c11aed751"},"cover":{"id":6071,"game":5916,"height":1080,"image_id":"sfben17pkmhmrrgtj8mk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sfben17pkmhmrrgtj8mk.jpg","width":1074,"checksum":"c1cae974-161a-4e24-5419-659ee82b10d6"},"first_release_date":959644800,"franchises":[{"id":382,"created_at":1396656000,"games":[5915,5916,5917,5918,5920,5921,49966],"name":"Mary-Kate and Ashley","slug":"mary-kate-and-ashley","updated_at":1396656000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/mary-kate-and-ashley","checksum":"ad90f3b0-c2a6-8a6c-e688-a71bfe4ecf92"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":14216,"company":{"id":287,"logo":{"id":447,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":249,"image_id":"qfyuxpskaackdzgnneal","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qfyuxpskaackdzgnneal.jpg","width":767,"checksum":"110da6d6-cd7d-3338-becb-404a5e482d27"},"name":"Acclaim Entertainment","slug":"acclaim-entertainment"}},{"id":14217,"company":{"id":901,"name":"Crawfish Interactive","slug":"crawfish-interactive"}}],"name":"Mary-Kate & Ashley: Get a Clue!","platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"id":14496,"category":0,"created_at":1396656000,"date":959644800,"game":5916,"human":"May 30, 2000","m":5,"platform":22,"region":8,"updated_at":1396656000,"y":2000,"checksum":"e45e995c-f0a8-fd96-058b-6de306bcb912"}],"screenshots":[{"id":373849,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":5916,"height":144,"image_id":"sc80gp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc80gp.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"7afd74a7-8840-c6d4-e633-afca6129d4a3"},{"id":373850,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":5916,"height":144,"image_id":"sc80gq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc80gq.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"cd230477-0002-42fa-4632-3dd40383130b"},{"id":373851,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":5916,"height":144,"image_id":"sc80gr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc80gr.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"d0d8acb4-b442-c4c4-1093-78310afa2280"}],"slug":"mary-kate-ashley-get-a-clue","summary":"Mary-Kate, Ashley, and their dog Clue are on the case in MARY-KATE & ASHLEY: Get a Clue!

Less of a serious simulation of tennis than other versions, the handheld edition features cartoony 2D graphics and outrageous court locations. \n \nAll-in-all, the game includes eight different players and twelve different tournaments. Only five players and four tournaments can be selected from the start, the others are unlocked by winning events. The starting tournaments are realistic grand slam events: the Roland Garros French Open (the only one with a license), the English Open (i.e. Wimbledon), the US Championship and the Australian Cup, on clay, grass or turf. Winning them unlocks the more unusual locations: from street and beach tournaments to far-out events in the Antarctic or on the moon. \n \nAll events are single elimination, starting at the quarter finals. Matches follow original rules, and are seen from a standard perspective behind the controlled player. All characters (players, officials and fans) are drawn in a cartoony style with oversized heads. The controls allow for a variety of moves including backhand and forehand shots, volleys and lobs.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/roland-garros-french-open"},{"id":49988,"collection":{"id":2270,"created_at":1468800000,"games":[3621,20649,20813,23464,44924,45003,49988],"name":"Triple Play","slug":"triple-play","updated_at":1468800000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/triple-play","checksum":"d11ff8f5-edcf-634b-7fe9-2a5bdb5368ee"},"first_release_date":960422400,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Triple Play 2001","platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"id":96502,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":960422400,"game":49988,"human":"Jun 08, 2000","m":6,"platform":22,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":2000,"checksum":"16a2d380-cb06-c27e-a2e4-44021c0b06a2"}],"slug":"triple-play-2001","summary":"The highly popular baseball series TRIPLE PLAY makes its appearance on the Game Boy Color with TRIPLE PLAY 2001.
